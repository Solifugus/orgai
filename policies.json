In addition, the statement provides for monitoring and communication protocols for the Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) and the Board of Directors (BOD) of AmeriCU Credit Union. Credit Union officials and management have a fiduciary responsibility to identify, measure, monitor, and control concentration risk. The purpose of the concentration risk policy is to identify areas of concentration risk and establish risk limits as a percentage of net worth. Setting up guidelines and reporting structures to ensure compliance with regulatory rules and Credit Union policies. This policy will not override any current policies including but not limited to lending, investments, and Asset Liability Management (ALM). The Credit Union feels its best investment is in a loan to one of its members. Establishing concentration risk limits affords the Credit Union parameters by which to diversify the loan portfolio and spread credit, interest rate, and liquidity risk. The parameters set should be specific to each asset class, loan portfolio, and share portfolio as well as concentrations with loans to one borrower (lending policy) or with a lead originator as it relates to loan participation purchases (loan participation policy). Concentration risk limits should align to overall growth objectives, financial targets, and net worth plans of the Credit Union. Management will monitor concentration risks exceeding 100% of net worth and disclose to the Board of Directors (BOD) and Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) on a quarterly basis. In addition, management will monitor actual balance concentrations to established limits and assess opportunities to mitigate concentration exposure through subsequent quarter actions. If management determines concentration risk is elevated, corrective actions include but are not limited to: Increasing limits on risk concentrations to the extent business and growth initiatives warrant acceptance of higher concentration thresholds Reducing exposure to business lines contributing to undue concentrations Transferring risk to other parties through selling individual loans or pools via loan participations Ceasing to offer the product line SCOPE All AmeriCU employees DEFINITIONS A risk concentration is any single exposure or group of exposures with the potential to produce losses large enough relative to net worth to threaten the Credit Union\u2019s health or ability to maintain its core operations. Avoiding concentrating too much in any single asset class or product is a core tenet of effective risk management. The Credit Union will monitor and report on any risk concentrations that are greater than 100% of net worth. Changes in balance sheet composition warrant that concentration risk limits adjust; as such, management will conduct an annual review of this Concentration Risk Policy. RESPONSIBILITIES The Board of Directors\u2019 role is to set the level of concentration risk it is comfortable in taking relative to net worth for each balance sheet line item segment. The Board of Directors also is required to document an explanation for taking on a concentration risk that is greater than 100% of net worth. The Board must be prepared to take action if the risk limits on any one certain segment exceeds policy limits. The Board of Directors delegates the responsibility to the President/Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Credit Union to provide quarterly reports of risk levels for the assigned segments in this risk policy. GUIDELINES AND LIMITS The Balance Sheet segments include material asset and liability classes. Major and minor classes align to the balance sheet presentation for purposes of determining an aggregate line item exposure. In establishing the concentration risk policy limits, the Credit Union has considered its strategic plan, growth initiatives, and other related policy characteristics coupled with potential earnings growth that support future net worth growth. Expressed as percentage of net worth at risk or as a percentage of portfolio balance for high LTV portfolio's , segmentation and policy limits for concentration risk are as follows: MONITORING POLICY COMPLIANCE Management will monitor the concentration risk categories using the following \"heat map\" for managing risk and reporting concentrations: Low Concentration Risk No corrective action warranted Continue to monitor growth and manage balance sheet composition Moderate Concentration Risk BOD reporting and communication Management justifies the level of risk Quarterly monitoring of concentration and risk levels Use balance sheet diversification tactics to contain concentration levels High Concentration Risk BOD reporting and communication Management justifies the level of risk Quarterly monitoring of concentration and risk levels Use balance sheet diversification tactics to contain concentration levels Evaluate and determine corrective actions to reduce risk level Justify raising risk limits with supporting evidence and forecasts that demonstrate no negative impact to net worth and the net worth ratio in a twelve month horizon In addition, the Credit Union may perform additional analysis to include but not limited to the following: Increasing net worth through increased operating earnings Increase loan rates Decrease share rates Increase non-interest income (i.e., fees from services, CUO contributions, other operating income) Reduce operating or non-interest expenses Eliminate unprofitable lines of business Close unprofitable financial centers Decreasing assets Reduce shares via run-off and/or lower share rates Prepay borrowings, if applicable Curtailing loan product offerings contributing high amounts of credit risk Selling individual loans in the secondary market and/or loan pools through loan participations Performing scenario and sensitivity analysis affecting assumptions that could have a negative impact on financial results as a result of high concentration risk levels Performing loan level detail attribute analysis to identify trends in credit that drive higher credit risk for the Credit Union and strengthen underwriting guidelines where feasible Monitor credit score concentration aligned to current credit score tier levels to net worth for specific \"high risk\" products POLICY EXCEPTION Excessive concentration risk can severely affect the financial condition of the Credit Union. High concentrations in areas experiencing severe economic distress could result in significant losses stressing net worth. Credit Union officials and the CEO share the responsibility to identify, manage, monitor and control concentration risk. Understanding, limiting, and mitigating concentration risk is the focus of this policy statement. Any exception to this policy shall first be discussed with the CEO and presented to ALCO at its next regularly scheduled meeting. ALCO promulgated changes to address noncompliance will be presented to the BOD at its next regularly scheduled meeting.

The BOD approves the policy statement annually and delegates its responsibility to the Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) and Management to establish an allowance for loan loss that sufficiently supports Management's estimate of potential losses within the loan portfolio. This policy aims to establish a governance protocol and policy statement that provides for BOD oversight of the allowance for loan and lease loss calculation on a monthly basis. This policy aims to provide guidelines that will help to ensure that the accounting for the ALLL is in compliance with AmeriCU policy and conforms, in all material respects, to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (USGAAP), guidance provided by the NCUA, and New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS). SCOPE All AmeriCU employees and members DEFINITIONS N/A RESPONSIBILITY 1. _Chief Financial Officer (CFO)_ The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) is responsible for administering and determining a reasonable ALLL through periodic charges to the provision for loan loss. The BOD recognizes that substantial judgment is required in calculating the ALLL and that Management must exercise those judgments in a disciplined manner. 2. _Board of Directors_ The BOD is responsible for policy governance and delegating responsibility for the evaluation and assessment of the Credit Union's ALLL calculation. To fulfill this responsibility, the BOD instructs ALCO to develop and maintain an appropriate, systematic, and consistently applied process to determine the ALLL and related provision for loan loss on a monthly basis. 3. _Asset Liability Committee_ ALCO will review the applicable ALLL calculation, assessment, and reporting quarterly. This review will be documented in the ALCO minutes and a summary of the ALLL balance and calculation will be attached to the minutes and submitted to the BOD for their review and approval. Adjustments and/or corrective actions will be addressed as warranted and disclosed to the BOD at the next regularly scheduled BOD meeting. 4. _Chief Financial Officer_ As chairperson of ALCO, the CFO is charged with the responsibility to develop an ALL methodology that complies with this policy statement and conforms, in all material respects, to USGAAP and regulatory guidance to compute and record a sufficient ALLL and related provision for loan loss on a monthly basis. This methodology is based on CECL rules. CECL requires financial institutions to recognize lifetime expected credit losses for a wide range of financial assets based not only on past events and current conditions, but also on reasonable and supportable forecasts.The CFO also provides appropriate disclosure and reporting to the BOD on a monthly basis demonstrating the Credit Union's allowance for loan loss assessment and calculation summary. Quarterly, the CFO facilitates a review of the ALLL with ALCO providing current and future quarter actions for the purpose of assessing and determining the sufficiency of the Credit Union's estimate for loan loss. 5. _Supervisory Committee_ The Supervisory Committee is responsible for the oversight and monitoring of internal controls over the ALLL determination process. In addition, the Supervisory Committee takes responsibility to validate the ALLL methodology periodically by conducting a review of the ALLL methodology and its application. The review is done by a reputable external audit group and includes reviews of all calculation\u2019s assumptions, methodologies and software where applicable.The Supervisory Committee provides the oversight, as required by the Supervisory Committee Charter, and delegates the annual \u201cvalidation\u201d of the ALLL to the independent external auditor, and the ongoing \"monitoring\" to the internal audit department. 6. GUIDELINES AND LIMITS 1. The ALLL recorded pursuant to USGAAP is the Credit Union's best estimate of the probable amount of credit losses on financial assets that are expected over the life of those financial assets. Estimating the amount of an ALLL involves a high degree of management judgment. While there are no promulgated \"limits\" for an allowance within USGAAP or regulatory guidance, there are stipulated guidelines that must be included to establish a sufficient ALLL. This includes but is not limited to the following: Loan type segmentation stratifying loan types by similar characteristics Further stratification for calculation of a general and specific reserve General reserve for those loan types evaluated as a homogenous pool Applying the most applicable CECL calculation to each pool for DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) or WARM (Weighted Average Remaining Maturity) based on the characteristics of each pool. Utilizing proper historical or industry rates to determine probability of default and loss given probability of default for each segmented pool of assets. Specific reserve for those loan types evaluated individually or at the loan level (TDR) Troubled Debt Restructures and (TLM) Troubled Loan Modifications. Real estate loans greater than 180 days delinquent. A real estate appraisal will be utilized to determine the proper value of the property for adjustment purposes. The Credit Solutions department will provide updated appraisals. Appraisals used should not be more than 6 months old. Investment impairment. AmeriCU utilizes information from the broker (Raymond James) to determine impairment on Investments under CECL rules. Reserve on unfunded commitments under CECL rules. Impaired Commercial Loans 2. In addition to loan type stratification and the application of forecasted lifetime credit losses per CECL, management must apply qualitative risk factors that provide for an incremental component to the calculation estimate. Under CECL, these factors will provide a much smaller contribution to the ALLL than under the previous (ILM) Incurred Loss Methodology as the application of future lifetime losses on credit assets provides for a more precise loss calculation than the previous methodology. These factors, which follow inter-agency guidance, may include but are not limited to the following: 1. Changes in international, national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the condition of various market segments. 2. Changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of the loans. 3. Changes in the volume and severity of past due loans (delinquencies), the volume of nonaccrual loans, and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded loans. 4. Changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans. 5. The effect of any other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the credit union's existing portfolio. 3. A baseline will be established and documented for all qualitative risk factors. All adjustments to qualitative risk factors from baseline will by tracked and documented along with a narrative to explain managements justification for deviating from the baseline. 7. MONITORING POLICY COMPLIANCE 1. The CFO will prepare a document that summarizes the amount to be reported in the financial statements for the ALLL. The ALCO will review the allowance calculation quarterly; a summary of the ALLL is provided monthly to the BOD. The summary will include: 1. An estimate of the probable loss incurred for each segment evaluated. 2. The aggregate probable loss estimated using the credit union's CECL methodology. 3. A summary of the current ALLL balance. 4. The amount, if any, by which the ALLL was adjusted. 2. Annually, the external audit firm reviews the sufficiency of management's allowance estimate. 3. ALCO and the BOD will review this policy statement at least annually. 4. A full third party CECL model validation will be performed every three years. 8. POLICY EXCEPTION 1. Ineffective monitoring and management of the allowance for loan and lease losses could result in significant exposures for the Credit Union that could stress earnings and net worth. Credit Union officials and the CEO share the responsibility to identify, manage, and monitor the allowance assessment. Understanding the operating environment, loan origination goals, loan attributes and related statistics assists management and the BOD in assessing the sufficiency of the allowance calculation. Establishing proper governance processes is the focus of this policy statement. 2. Any exception to this policy will first be discussed with the CEO and presented to ALCO at its next regularly scheduled meeting. Potential corrective action strategies and intentions will be identified and disclosed to the BOD at their next regularly scheduled meeting.

The investments should meet the following objectives: 1. Provide liquidity for the Credit Union 2. Make safe, productive use of the Credit Union's idle funds 3. Offset the Credit Union's share deposits at a matched or positive spread 4. Manage interest rate risk and its impact on the market value of the balance sheet These objectives are not mutually exclusive; therefore, the Credit Union's investments can meet one or more of these objectives. SCOPE All AmeriCU Employees DEFINITIONS N/A RESPONSIBILITY 1. Authority for and review of the Credit Union's investments shall rest with the BOD.

It is essential for the Credit Union to have knowledge concerning the securities firms and the representatives with which it transacts business. Because of this requirement, the Board shall have the responsibility of reviewing, at least on an annual basis, the securities firms with which the Credit Union currently does business and approving any new firms. 2. This broker-dealer review and approval will be part of the Board's minutes. The Credit Union should maintain the documentation used to approve a broker-dealer as long as the broker-dealer is approved and until the documentation has been both audited and examined. 3. For each securities dealer with which the Credit Union does business, the Investment Committee will perform an annual review and keep on file the following information: The ability of the broker-dealer to fulfill commitments, as evidenced by its capital strength, liquidity, and operating results. The Credit Union will consider annual reports, current financial data, statistical rating agencies, and other sources of financial information.

Special attention shall be paid to safekeeping of collateral in repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements. All securities are to be settled using the delivery versus payment (DVP) method. This requires the seller to deliver the instrument to the buyer simultaneously with the payment. The Board shall adopt and review annually a statement concerning possible conflicts of interest with those employees directly involved in securities transactions for the Credit Union so that there are no conflicts between the execution of Credit Union and personal transactions. This statement will also include guidelines concerning the receipt of gifts, gratuities, or travel expenses from approved securities dealers. The Credit Union maintains its safekeeping relationship with the following institutions: Federal Reserve Bank of New York 33 Liberty Street New York, NY 10045 Raymond James 1100 Ridgeway Loop Road, Suite 550 Memphis, TN 38120 6. Guidelines and Limits 1. The Credit Union CFO, currently designated as Investment Officer, is granted the authority to purchase investments that are aligned to state and federal regulations. Specifically, all investment categories defined within the Federal Credit Union Act, Section 703 are allowable and include, but are not limited to, the following: U.S. Treasury Bills, Notes, and Bonds U.S. Agency Notes, Bonds, Debentures, and Certificates Accounts of credit unions, savings and loan associations, mutual savings banks, or commercial banks whose accounts are insured by the National Credit Union Association or Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Bank Notes Mortgage-Backed Securities / 1-4 Family (MBS Pass-through) Mortgage related securities to include Collateralized Mortgage Obligations and Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits Multi-Family Mortgage-Backed Securities / Agency Commercial Mortgage-backed Securities (CMBS) Small Business Administration (SBA) Securities Municipal Bonds Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements Federal Funds Mutual Funds Derivatives (with prior state and federal regulator approval) 7. Investments for the purpose of match-funding employee benefit expenses are addressed in a separate policy statement ACU-02-004 Prefunded Employee Benefits Investment Management. 8. _Investment Criteria_ 1. _U.S. Treasury Bills, Notes, and Bonds_ Explicit guarantee of US government Maximum maturity of these securities shall be approximately fifteen (15) years 2. _U.S. Agency Securities_ Explicit or implicit guarantee of US government Shall include those of the Federal Farm Credit Banks (FFCB) Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB) Federal National Mortgage Association (\"Fannie Mae\") Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\"Freddie Mac\") Government National Mortgage Association (\"Ginnie Mae\") Student Loan Marketing Association (\"Sallie Mae\") Small Business Administration (SBA) U.S. Agency Discount Notes Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA; agency bullet) Agency Securities NOT defined as Structured Notes Maximum final maturity of these securities shall be approximately fifteen (15) years Agency Securities defined as Structured Notes Maximum final maturity of these securities shall be approximately fifteen (15) years 9. Structured debt obligations are securities that typically contain embedded options such as caps, calls, and floors. These obligations have cash flows that are linked to indices such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodities prices, prepayment rates, and other financial variables. The cash flows of certain structured notes can be variable in the timing and amount of cash received throughout the life of the security, depending upon the performance of the index/indices to which they are linked. 10. Structured Notes do not include Agency securities with call features only. The most common Structured Notes include: 1. Step-up Bonds Initially pay the investor an above-market yield for a short non-call period and then, if not called, \"step up\" to a higher coupon rate which will be below current market rates. 2. Index Amortizing Notes (IANs) Repay principal according to a predetermined amortization schedule that is linked to the level of a specific index. For example, as market interest rates increase, the maturity of an IAN extends. 3. Dual Index Notes These bonds have coupon rates that are determined by the difference between two market indices, typically the Constant Maturity Treasury (CMT) rate and Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). For example, the coupon formula might be 10 year CMT plus 300 basis points minus 3 month SOFR. 4. De-leveraged Bonds These bonds pay investors according to a formula that is based upon a fraction of the increase or decrease in a specified index. For example, the coupon might be 50% times 10 year CMT plus 150 basis points. 5. Range Bonds (Accrual Bonds) Pay the investor an above-market coupon rate as long as the reference rate is between levels established at issue. For each day that the reference rate is outside this range, the bonds earn no interest. For example, if SOFR is the reference rate, a bond might pay SOFR plus 75 basis points for each day SOFR is between 3.5% and 5.0%. When SOFR is less than 3.5% or more than 5.0%, the bond would accrue no interest. The Credit Union may not invest in a range bond with a \"variable redemption\" feature, or in other words, one in which the maturity value fluctuates according to a change in SOFR. 6. Inverse Floaters These bonds have coupons that increase as rates decline and decrease as rates rise. For example, the coupon might have a formula such as, 12% minus 3 month SOFR. 11. When evaluating Structured Notes or any floating rate security, the Credit Union may only invest as long as the index is tied to domestic interest rates and not, for example, to foreign currencies, foreign interest rates, domestic or foreign commodity prices, equity prices, or inflation rates. The U.S. dollar-denominated London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is considered a domestic interest rate, which has been replaced (June 30, 2023) with the SOFR, created and issued through the Federal Reserve Bank. 12. _Certificates of Deposit_ 1. Term deposit invested with credit unions, savings and loan associations, mutual savings banks, or commercial banks that must have the applicable federal insurance. 2. In all cases, certificates with an institution shall not exceed the insurance of principal and interest given by the appropriate insurance agency. 3. The maturity of all certificates held shall not exceed five (5) years. 13. _Bank Notes_ 1. Permissible as outlined in Part 703.14(f) of the NCUA Rules and Regulations 2.

Permissible as outlined in 107(7)(K) of the Federal Credit Union Act and in Part 703.14(e) of the NCUA Rules and Regulations 2. The municipal security must be rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization in one of the four highest rating categories defined below 3.

The maximum sector allocation to municipal securities is limited to 50% of the total investment portfolio par amount 5. Aggregate total of all municipal holdings may not exceed 75% of Net Worth (defined regulatory limit) 6. Maximum maturity of these securities shall be twenty (20) years 19. _Repurchase Agreements_ 1. Transaction in which the Credit Union agrees to purchase a security from a counterparty and to resell the same or an identical security to that counterparty at a specified future date and at a specified price 2. The Credit Union may enter into a repurchase transaction as long as the: Repurchase securities are legal investments for state and federal credit unions Credit Union receives a daily assessment of the market value of the repurchase securities including accrued interest Credit Union maintains adequate margin that reflects a risk assessment of the repurchase securities and the term of the transaction Credit Union has entered into signed contracts with all approved counterparties 20. _Reverse Repurchase Agreements_ 1.

Federal Funds sold shall be limited to recognized regional banks and major money center banks 2. Fed Funds sales to any one bank shall be limited to constraints established by the Board of Directors 3. Sales limits will be approved quarterly by the Board 4.

CFO will maintain current financial information on any bank in which the Credit Union has entered into a Fed Funds sold transaction 6. Should the CFO, at any time, doubt the financial position of a bank which is a part of a Fed Funds sold transaction, the CFO shall have the authority to terminate the Fed Funds transaction with the bank 7. Fed Funds transactions should have a maturity of one business day 22. _Mutual Funds_ 1. Permissible as outlined in Part 703.14(c) of the National Credit Union Association (NCUA) Rules and Regulations 2.

CFO has authority to initiate a derivatives program with approved broker-dealers 2. The program must receive unanimous consent from Investment Committee members to pursue state and federal regulatory approval 3.

Credit Union may not purchase a zero coupon investment in any of the above types if the maturity date is more than seven (7) years from the settlement date 2. While many individual investment options may have final maturities of thirty (30) years, overall portfolio management will be focused on a portfolio weighted average life of seven (7) years or less 3. The investment portfolio should be adequately diversified to mitigate interest rate, credit, liquidity, and concentration risk 25. _Financial Accounting Classifications_ 1. At the time of purchase, the security will be classified into one of three categories for financial accounting purposes. The Credit Union will default the investment classification to Available for Sale (AFS). Investment Committee approval will be required to classify an investment as Held to Maturity (HTM) or Trading. 26. A summary of each classification follows. 27. _Held to Maturity (HTM)_ 1. A classification specifically designated for those investments where the Credit Union has positive intent and the ability to hold the security to its stated final maturity. Securities classified as HTM can only be reclassified to other than HTM for the following reasons: A significant decline in an issuer's creditworthiness A major business combination or disposition that requires the reclassification of securities to maintain credit risk or interest rate risk positions Changes in statutory or regulatory requirements that modify parameters for permissible investments or levels of investments held Changes in the institution's capital requirements or risk weights for risk-based capital purposes The security is within three months of its maturity date or probable call date The security occurs after a substantial portion, defined as 85% of principal outstanding since acquisition date, has been returned. 28. _Trading_ 1. Securities classified as trading are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading designated securities are marked-to-market with unrealized gains/losses appearing in the income statement on a monthly basis. 29. _Available for Sale (AFS)_ 1. This classification indicates that the security is not held to maturity or trading. AFS designated securities are marked-to-market with unrealized gains/losses appearing as a separate component of Members' Equity. 30. _Reclassification_ 1. The reclassification of securities as held to maturity, trading, or available for sale is at fair value at the time of transfer. The Investment Committee will approve classification other than AFS with disclosure to the Board at the next monthly Board meeting. 31. _Other than Temporary Impairment_ 1. If at any time, management determines that it is probable that the issuer of the security will be unable to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the debt security, then the security will be written down to market value as an Other Than Temporary Impairment (OTTI) due to the credit concern of the issuer. 32. On a quarterly basis, management will evaluate the securities portfolio on a security-by-security basis to determine if other than temporary impairment needs to be recorded. If the market price is equal to or greater than the book carrying value, then there is no need to evaluate the security for OTTI. However, for securities in a loss position, management will determine if the security is a candidate for OTTI consideration using the following criteria: 1. If it is probable that the issuer of the security will be unable to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the debt security, then the security will be written down to market value as an OTTI due to the credit concern of the issuer. 2. If management plans to sell the security and does not expect to recover the loss before the anticipated sale date, then the security will be written down to market value as an OTTI. 3. If the security does not meet either criteria above and is in a loss position, management will determine if the magnitude and duration of the loss require a further review for OTTI. Further review will be performed for all securities that have been in a loss position for greater than one year and at a current loss of 20% or more. 33. For those securities meeting these parameters, management will be responsible to: 1. Document its intent and ability to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, or 2. Realize other than temporary impairment. 34. _Security Documentation_ 1. With each purchase or sale transaction, the CFO will perform a pre-purchase and/or pre-sale analysis of the transaction's impact on the investment portfolio. The analysis will include but not be limited to the following: Security level performance metrics in various rate scenarios Security attribute analysis (i.e., description, coupon, maturity, prepayment speeds, geography, collateral, average life, etc.) Purchase/sale price quote (i.e., third party indicative pricing such as Bloomberg or Reuters) Yield and income summary Price volatility impact Fed funds comparison impact (for single security purchases only; not needed for a sale or swap transaction) Average life impact Scenario analysis Cash flow analysis Portfolio level performance metrics impact Before / after transaction impact analysis Rate shock analysis in various rate environment scenarios Projected portfolio cash flows 35. The pre-purchase or pre-sale analysis documentation will be maintained within Treasury Operations to support the purchase or sale decision. In addition, all relevant security level detail obtained from applicable broker-dealers will be maintained. This documentation will include but not be limited to the following: 1. Transaction settlement summary worksheet 2. Broker-dealer transaction confirmation 3. Bloomberg trade information summary 4. Bloomberg yield table analysis 5. Bloomberg security description 6. Bloomberg collateral composition summary 7. Bloomberg geography composition 8. Bloomberg quartiles summary of security attributes 36. The documentation will be maintained in Treasury Operations and provided to those who support the confirmation and verification process with the safekeeping agent. Copies of this information will be sent to all relevant parties including personnel who settles the trade, maintains files on the securities, and who accounts for the security. 37. Treasury Operations will maintain documentation regarding an investment transaction as long as the Credit Union owns the investment and until the documentation has been both audited and examined. In addition to the above information, documentation will include any other financial data, tests, or reports required by this investment policy. 38. Monitoring Policy Compliance 1. On a monthly basis, the investment portfolio will be priced by an industry standard pricing service and will be reported at the next scheduled meeting of the Investment Committee. Cash flows will be projected under a variety of economic, prepayment, and interest rate scenarios. Analytics will be calculated on the expected cash flows to provide a variety of metrics to project income and interest rate risk. 2. The pre-purchase analysis shall demonstrate that each investment was subject to a price sensitivity test. With bond investments, post-purchase sensitivity is focused on a rising rate environment, which creates price depreciation or potential losses. In a decreasing rate environment, a bond will demonstrate price appreciation given the stated coupon interest rate is higher than current market rates. 3. As such, the investment policy stresses the significance of price depreciation in a rising rate environment. Policy limits are established to assist management in mitigating price depreciation interest rate risk at the time of purchase. The price sensitivity test must reflect an immediate, sustained, parallel change in prevailing interest rates of plus 100, 200, and 300 basis points. All sensitivity tests must be performed using a model available from a reputable third party such as Bloomberg model output. 4. Generally, an investment security shall not be purchased if the measured interest rate sensitivity of that security exceeds the policy limits in the following table: Projected Rate Change | Market Value Sensitivity Limits of Net Worth ---|--- Cautionary Limit | Policy Limit +100 bps (1%) | -7% | -10% +200 bps (2%) | -18% | -20% +300 bps (3%) | -25% | -30% 5. The CFO, as Investment Officer, has discretion to purchase a security if its price volatility in a +100 or +200 rate scenario exceeds above policy limits but remains within policy limits of a +300 rate scenario. These discretionary exceptions will be documented at the security level and presented to the Investment Committee at the next regularly scheduled Committee meeting. 39. _Reporting_ 1. The Investment Committee chairperson will facilitate the preparation of a quarterly reporting package with the support of the Treasury Operations Senior Financial Analyst and the VP of Finance. The reporting package will include but not be limited to the following: Prior meeting minutes Review of internally managed investments Review of externally managed investments including benefit investment income compared to benefit expense Portfolio performance Recommended changes to investment strategies Available cash analysis for future investment purposes (i.e., loan origination, loan participations, investment security purchases/sales) \"Next quarter\" action recommendations 2. In addition, required Section 703 reporting will be provided. These reports include a monthly presentation at the security level of the following: Fair value and dollar change since the prior month-end, with summary information for the entire portfolio Fair values of all fixed and variable rate securities held that have one or more of the following features: Embedded options Remaining maturities greater than 3 years Coupon formulas that are related to more than one index or are inversely related to, or multiples of an index 3. Where the amounts calculated here are greater than net capital, disclosures will include an estimate of the potential impact of an immediate and sustained parallel shift in market interest rates of plus 300 basis points on the fair value of each security in the portfolio, the fair value of the portfolio as a whole, and the Credit Union's net capital. Investment Committee members will receive copies of the reports Board members will receive meeting minutes summarizing results with reports available upon request 4. Additional reporting will be provided as requested or deemed necessary. 40. _Conflicts of Interest_ 1. Credit Union employees who are directly involved in purchasing and selling investment securities shall not engage in personal securities transactions with any firm on the Credit Union's list of approved broker-dealers without specific, prior Investment Committee approval. 2. Directors, officers, or employees of the Credit Union may not accept more than nominal ($50 or less) gifts, gratuities, or travel expenses from firms on the Credit Union's list of approved broker-dealers or from personnel employed by those firms. 3. The Credit Union should incur all costs associated with training or travel expenses in conjunction with seminars that broker-dealers may conduct or sponsor. 41. Policy Exception 1. The above policy is meant to be a flexible guide for the Investment Officer. However, occurrences and opportunities will present themselves which could result in investments which are not included in the policy or beyond the recommended maturities and/or makeup of the investment portfolio. 2. Whenever circumstances require a prompt action that will violate a provision of this policy, but which is nevertheless prudent, the CEO shall be authorized to approve the policy exception. No such exception may be authorized, however, if it would cause the Credit Union to violate an applicable law or regulation. All authorized exceptions must be reported to the Investment Committee at the next regularly scheduled Investment Committee and/or Board of Directors meeting, whichever comes first.

These externally managed portfolios were created to utilize otherwise impermissible investments for the sole purpose of providing additive interest, dividend, and capital earnings to offset employee benefit costs of the Credit Union and related entities. Investment vehicles include but are not limited to otherwise impermissible investments such as: Institutional Insurance Business Owned Life Insurance \u2013 BOLI Credit Union Owned Life Insurance \u2013 COLI Collateral Assignment Split Dollar Benefit Funds U.S. Equities International Equities Mutual Funds Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) High Quality Fixed Income Bonds (i.e., Agency, Corporate, Private Label) The AmeriCU Credit Union Board of Directors (BOD) has created this document to establish investment guidelines for use in conjunction with its use of alternative investments for accumulating assets to pay for employee benefit obligations. The National Credit Union Association (NCUA) has indicated that federal credit unions in reliance on 12 CFR Sec. 701.19(a), in parity with the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS), may use otherwise impermissible investments to fund employee benefit obligations as long as there is a direct connection between the investment and the employee benefit obligation. This investment policy establishes and documents the Credit Union's due diligence and risk management processes related to employee benefit plans and their underlying investments, which could include \"otherwise impermissible\" assets. SCOPE All AmeriCU Business Units and Board of Directors DEFINITIONS 1. _Benefit Plans -_ Employee benefit plans serve a number of appropriate business purposes, such as helping a credit union attract and retain staff. The BOD will ensure that benefits provided to employees and officers will be reasonable and commensurate with employee responsibilities while taking into consideration the Credit Union's financial condition. Where possible, the Credit Union will compare recent compensation surveys for similar positions in peer institutions, as well as other available means of comparison. The Credit Union will also consult with third-party vendors with expertise in employee benefits. Benefit plans could include but are not limited to the following types: Defined benefit plans Provide a fixed monthly benefit at retirement Base the benefit on a specific formula Defined contribution plans General employee benefit plans broader in nature Contain plans such as 401(k), 457(b), 457(f), split dollar (endorsement and loan regime) It is anticipated that the Credit Union will implement one or more employee benefit plans using an investment as the funding vehicle. Permanent insurance is typically used to fund these types of plans. The BOD will exercise enhanced oversight of these plans. 2. _Investment Authority -_ NCUA Regulation \u00a7701.19 permits a credit union to fund benefit plans with investments that would otherwise be impermissible under current rules, provided the investment is directly related to the credit union's obligation or potential obligation under the employee benefit plan. The Credit Union, with assistance from qualified vendors, will demonstrate a \"direct relationship\" between the benefit plan and the investment as follows: Demonstrating that a benefit plan is in place prior to or concurrent with funding, including formal adoption of such plan and a calculation of annual plan expenses using reasonable and supportable methods and assumptions. Ensuring that the investment is appropriate for the Credit Union to hold using standard due diligence procedures that apply to investments. Validating that investment return characteristics meet the criteria discussed in regulatory guidance. Demonstrating the investment generally has a predictable return over the time horizon associated with the benefit to offset the benefit obligation costs. Verifying that the expected return of the applicable investment portfolio does not exceed the projected cost of the applicable employee benefit. The BOD has determined that the Credit Union requires flexibility to use alternative investments in order to effectively manage its long-term employee benefits costs. In doing so, portfolio management should meet the following objectives: Provide for additive income and capital appreciation. Maximize cash flow and liquidity for long term growth. Manage earnings volatility and reinvestment risk. Maintain appropriate asset allocation strategies relevant to the economic environment for long-term match-funding of employee benefit costs of the Credit Union. 3. _Risk Awareness-_ Management should be aware of the following risks and how to deploy mitigation strategies to minimize investment exposure: Credit Risk - the Credit Union, in conjunction with its vendors, will monitor credit quality and avoid any excessive concentration in a single obligor. Interest Rate Risk - the Credit Union will document projected investment cash flows and model any proposed purchases using a net economic value (NEV) or net interest income (NII) simulation using reasonable and supportable assumptions for employee benefit liabilities. Liquidity Risk - the Credit Union will be aware of any surrender charges by reviewing the investment contract(s) carefully. Transactional and Operational Risk - the Credit Union will ensure proper accounting under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for the investment and any associated benefit plan. Consideration should be given to the following: There may be an immediate negative earnings impact upon purchase. Insurance purchases are often associated with long-term obligations. Accounting for insurance assets may involve restating financials if the credit union does not properly account for the unique aspects of pre- and post-purchase obligations. Credit unions should track former employees in order to properly account for and be aware of potential cash inflows. Compliance Risk - the Credit Union will engage outside counsel to help mitigate risk on legal and regulatory issues associated with the investment and benefit plan. Strategic Risk - the Credit Union will not commit to excessive or unaffordable employee benefits that may materially impact future income or future hiring or merger plans. The Credit Union is aware of early termination of insurance policies and their impact on the income statement. Reputation Risk - the Credit Union will comply with all rules and regulations applicable for each investment and benefit structure in order to mitigate reputation risk. 4. _Accounting -_ The Credit Union will perform accounting due diligence on employee benefits in accordance with US GAAP and Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rules using licensed accountants, if necessary. All decisions regarding accounting policy will be documented. Loan regime split dollar arrangements will record loan value as follows: Nonrecourse: recorded on the balance sheet at liquidation value of the insurance policy Recourse: recorded at origination value Both types: the credit union may only report a value equal to or less than value of the loan, plus accrued interest, on the balance sheet. No value in excess of the loan may be reported. 5. _Pre-purchase Analysis of Investments -_ Prior to acquisition of an otherwise impermissible investment under 701.19, the Credit Union, under BOD supervision, will conduct a pre-purchase analysis to ensure the Credit Union understands the risks, rewards, and unique characteristics of the investment. The following elements will be included in such an analysis: The nature and extent of the analysis will be commensurate with the size and complexity of the purchase. It will also take into account current investments for employee benefit holdings. The Credit Union will maintain records of pre-purchase analyses, including purpose and amount of investments. The Credit Union will follow the ten steps more fully set forth in the NCUA Examination Guidance, as summarized below: Identify the need for the investment. Ensure the amount and direct relationship of investments are appropriate. Determine the economic benefits and appropriate investment type. Assess the qualifications of insurance vendor(s), if applicable. Review the characteristics of available insurance products. Review the characteristics of available non-insurance products. Select a counter-party. Analyze the associated risks and the ability to monitor and respond to risks. Evaluate alternatives. Make and document the investment decision.

Third party investment managers will rely on economic analysis, credit rating changes and other market factors coupled with Credit Union management interaction on organizational needs and changes that warrant a change in investment strategy over the PFEB portfolios. Additional funding needs to support the investment portfolio objectives shall be evaluated on an annual basis with the review of Credit Union employee benefit obligation costs. In addition, the Investment Committee and BOD will review and approve this policy statement at least annually. _Reporting -_ Third party investment managers are responsible for reporting to the Investment Officer, Investment Committee and/or the BOD no less than quarterly to review the current economic and market outlook, the portfolio's asset allocation, and performance. _Conflicts of Interest_ Credit Union employees who are directly involved in purchasing and selling investment securities shall not engage in personal securities transactions with any firm that manages an investment portfolio on behalf of the Credit Union without specific, prior Investment Committee approval. Directors, officers, or employees of the Credit Union may not accept more than nominal ($50 or less) gifts, gratuities, or travel expenses from firms that manage an investment portfolio on behalf of the Credit Union or from personnel employed by those firms. The Credit Union should incur all costs associated with training or travel expenses in conjunction with seminars that portfolio managers may conduct or sponsor. 6. Policy Exception 1. The above policy is meant to be a flexible guide for the Investment Officer in managing the expectations of an external investment portfolio manager. However, occurrences and opportunities will present themselves which could result in investments which are not included in the policy. 2. Whenever circumstances require a prompt action that will violate a provision of this policy but which is nevertheless prudent, the CEO shall be authorized to approve the policy exception. No such exception may be authorized, however, if it would cause the Credit Union to violate an applicable law or regulation. All authorized exceptions must be reported to the Investment Committee at the next regularly scheduled Investment Committee and/or BOD meeting, whichever comes first. 7. GUIDELINES AND LIMITS 1. The Investment Officer will coordinate quarterly meetings with Portfolio Management. During the quarterly meetings, the Investment Officer will review the following matters: Portfolio holdings and related investment grade rating Purchase and sale activities Needs of the Credit Union which would cause a shift in the asset allocation Potential growth and additional funding opportunities to maximize earnings potential 2. Summary reports and statements will be provided to the Investment Committee quarterly with any matters disclosed to the BOD as warranted. 3. _Safekeeping -_ The portfolio manager will utilize its safekeeping agent for the investments. The Investment Officer or designate will be provided monthly and quarterly reports as warranted. Accounting and Treasury Operations within the Credit Union will perform all accounting and reconciliation procedures related to the portfolio. 4. _Permitted Investments -_ To meet the above investment objectives, external investment managers can use the following asset classes: Permissible investments noted in investment policy statement 1.03 Institutional Insurance Business Owned Life Insurance \u2013 BOLI Credit Union Owned Life Insurance \u2013 COLI Collateral Assignment Split Dollar Benefit Funds U.S. Equities International Equities Mutual Funds Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) High Quality Fixed Income Bonds (i.e., Agency, Corporate, Private Label) 5. _Investment Criteria_ _Institutional Insurance_ Insurance plans associated with the funding of executive benefits and related investments will be used at the discretion of the BOD. As such, all third party vendor support, administration and related approvals will be promulgated by and through the BOD. Finance will maintain all necessary documentation to support related accounting entries and maintaining Credit Union books and records to support the funding and accounting of such investments. 6. _Benefit Investment Funds_ External investment managers have discretion to comply with an asset allocation strategy that aligns to a moderate conservative risk profile. The Credit Union's asset allocation range can and will fluctuate given economic conditions, state and federal regulatory requirements, US GAAP promulgated changes, and Credit Union directives based on needs and changing market factors impacting short- and long-term employee benefit obligations. The benefit investment fund portfolio asset allocation range is as follows: Asset Category | Asset Allocation Range ---|--- U.S. Equities | No more than 40% International Equities | No more than 10% Mutual Funds / ETFs | No more than 10% High Quality Bonds | No more than 100% While policy provides for a range for asset allocation composition of otherwise impermissible investments, the Credit Union elected in 2019 to shift the portfolio assets to 100% corporate bonds and cash. As a result of 2019 US GAAP promulgated changes in financial reporting requirements, the Credit Union elected to shift benefit investment funds into corporate bonds for the sole purpose of eliminating earnings volatility being reported in the income statement. The US GAAP changes required all equity, mutual fund, and exchange traded funds to have a monthly mark-to-market adjustment for changes in fair value reported in the income statement. Under current guidance, the mark-to-market for corporate bonds is treated as unrealized gains/losses and reported as other comprehensive income in the balance sheet. Specific to bond investments, all portfolio holdings shall be rated investment grade of BBB- or greater by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. Those categories shall include prime, high grade, upper medium grade, and lower medium grade as noted below: The Investment Committee, through recommendation of the CFO/Investment Officer, will authorize asset allocation changes based on the financial condition of the Credit Union and its ability to sustain significant market volatility, market conditions, and the potential need for earnings and/or investment gains. 7. _Financial Accounting Classifications -_ At the time of purchase, the security will be classified into one of three categories for financial accounting purposes. The Credit Union will default the investment classification to Available for Sale (AFS). Investment Committee approval will be required to classify an investment as Held to Maturity (HTM) or Trading. A summary of each classification follows. 8. _Held to Maturity (HTM) -_ A classification specifically designated for those investments where the Credit Union has positive intent and the ability to hold the security to its stated final maturity. Securities classified as HTM can only be reclassified to other than HTM for the following reasons: A significant decline in an issuer's creditworthiness. A major business combination or disposition that requires the reclassification of securities to maintain credit risk or interest rate risk positions. Changes in statutory or regulatory requirements that modify parameters for permissible investments or levels of investments held. Changes in the institution's capital requirements or risk weights for risk-based capital purposes The security is within three months of its maturity date or probable call date. The security occurs after a substantial portion, defined as 85% of principal outstanding since acquisition date, has been returned. 9. _Trading -_ Securities classified as trading are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading designated securities are marked-to-market with unrealized gains/losses appearing in the income statement on a monthly basis. 10. _Available for Sale (AFS) -_ This classification indicates that the security is not held to maturity or trading. AFS designated securities are marked-to-market with unrealized gains/losses appearing as a separate component of Members' Equity. 11. _Reclassification -_ The reclassification of securities as held to maturity, trading, or available for sale is at fair value at the time of transfer. The Investment Committee will approve classification other than AFS with disclosure to the BOD at the next monthly BOD meeting. 12. _Other than Temporary Impairment_ If at any time, management determines that it is probable that the issuer of the security will be unable to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the debt security, then the security will be written down to market value as an Other Than Temporary Impairment (OTTI) due to the credit concern of the issuer. On a quarterly basis, management will evaluate the securities portfolio on a security-by-security basis to determine if other than temporary impairment needs to be recorded. If the market price is equal to or greater than the book carrying value, then there is no need to evaluate the security for OTTI. However, for securities in a loss position, management will determine if the security is a candidate for OTTI consideration using the following criteria: If it is probable that the issuer of the security will be unable to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the debt security, then the security will be written down to market value as an OTTI due to the credit concern of the issuer. If management plans to sell the security and does not expect to recover the loss before the anticipated sale date, then the security will be written down to market value as an OTTI. If the security does not meet either criteria above and is in a loss position, management will determine if the magnitude and duration of the loss require a further review for OTTI. Further review will be performed for all securities that have been in a loss position for greater than one year and at a current loss of 20% or more. For those securities meeting these parameters, management will be responsible to: 1. Document its intent and ability to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, or 2. Realize other than temporary impairment. 13. _Security Documentation_ The portfolio manager is required to maintain all purchase and sale documentation on behalf of the Credit Union. Applicable monthly, quarterly, and annual statements and custodian reports shall be provided to the Credit Union. Investment Committee meeting minutes shall summarize Investment Officer quarterly review meetings with portfolio management. Committee and BOD disclosure shall be provided as warranted for significant changes in the investment strategy. 14. _Limits -_ The Credit Union has established the following procedures to further ensure compliance with all applicable rules and regulations governing employee benefit plans and otherwise impermissible investments: Limit Credit Union's exposure to single non-governmental obligors to no greater than 15% of net worth. Limit aggregate exposure to otherwise impermissible investments to 50% of net worth. If an aggregate exposure of greater than 50% is anticipated, the Credit Union will conduct due diligence and risk analysis intended to meet this expanded limit. Establish the existence of insurable interest upon purchase, and ensure the breakout of cash surrender value for different types of benefit plans (senior executive retirement plans, split dollar, key person, etc.) Confirm that otherwise impermissible investments are only used to fund qualifying employee benefit plan expenses. Determine if the investment product meets the \"direct relationship\" test by quantifying the benefits using reasonable and supportable methods and assumptions.

Part 210, Regulation E: Electronic Funds Transfers and Uniform Commercial Code Article 4A, which permits alternative handling based upon individual Credit Union policies and procedures. The purpose of this document is to set forth written policy adopted by AmeriCU Credit Union [hereafter referred to as \u201cCredit Union\u201d] regarding the management of activities and procedures of the Automated Clearing House (ACH) service operation. This is a living document, subject to revision in conjunction with the current NACHA Operating Rules & Guidelines, [hereafter referred to as the NACHA Rules]. All employees of AmeriCU Credit Union must comply with the terms of this policy. SCOPE Deposit Services; Finance and Accounting Operations; Financial Centers This policy aims to address all areas of ACH activity, including receipt of ACH transactions (RDFI) and origination of ACH transactions (ODFI). All employees of AmeriCU Credit Union must comply with the terms of this policy. This policy applies to the following: Credit Union employees Any organization or member with a contractual relationship with Credit Union Information in all forms, including oral, written, image and electronic Physical and logical (non-physical) security of all forms of data All modes of information processing, including, but not limited to, manual methods, hardware and software networks, other devices and information disposal techniques Information used by Credit Union which originates outside, including, but not limited to, vendors, contractors, members, regulators, other enterprises and the public domain Credit Union\u2019s information resources used by, shared by or in the custody of its vendors and/or affiliates. DEFINITIONS _N/A_ RESPONSIBILITY 1. Strategies 1. Senior Management realizes that with proper training and adoption of policies and procedures instituted throughout the organization, receipt of ACH transactions poses a limited amount of risk. 2. The receipt of ACH transactions, as well as the ACH origination portfolio, will be administered to conform to the directives of this policy and will conform to all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations, including the NACHA Rules. 2.

Credit Union personnel may submit an internal memorandum to the Chief Leadership Team (CLT) and Manager of Deposit Operations for consideration. 3. Information Technology / Security Risk 1. _General_ \u2013 Refer to the Information Security Program and Policy 1. Credit Union provides ACH services through a complex technology environment. Credit Union\u2019s ACH systems use multiple applications, processing, storage and communication systems that can be accessed by many internal and external users. 2. Those systems may be operated by the Credit Union, the Credit Union\u2019s customers, or various service providers. An ACH Operator [EPN] will be used for transaction clearing and settlement. 3. Many of the communication and processing systems necessary to provide ACH services are not unique to the services. Effective risk management of the complex ACH technology environment requires a disciplined approach to the identification, measurement and management of technology-related risks. 4. At a minimum, the information security program will address key control functions of information security and business continuity planning for the following: _Customer Access_ \\- Credit Union Management will ensure dual control and confidentiality in the initial setup and activation of new customers regardless of the communication channel. Credit Union will secure the distribution and reset process for any authenticators used to access ACH services. _Employee Access_ \\- Credit Union Management will minimize and monitor the number of personnel with access to systems that support ACH services. Credit Union will minimize and segregate ACH staff and limit access to various maintenance and transaction support functions. _Vendor / Third-Party Service Provider Access_ \\- Credit Union Management will ensure contracts are reviewed and monitored accordingly. Refer to the Third-Party Risk Management Policy. 5. Additionally, Management will maintain effective control over services that provide access to customer and Credit Union information consistent with Gramm-Leach Bliley Act 501(b). 6. Contractual provisions will define the terms of acceptable access and potential liabilities in the event of fraud or processing errors. 2. _Data Security_ 1. Credit Union Management will ensure that sound, risk-based data security policies, procedures and practices exist across all ACH-related systems, applications and processes. The policies, practices and systems address initiation, processing, storage and destruction of entries associated with Protected Information. 2.

ACH operations personnel will accept data only from properly authenticated sources and provide a secure communication channel for all critical or confidential data. Management will identify critical or confidential data used in ACH operations and ensure that proper storage and disposal practices are used. 4. Key practices will include purging data from online applications, encrypting data and destroying trace data from any media. 3. _Business Continuity Planning_ 1. Management will ensure that business units maintain up-to-date assessments due to increased corporate-wide and customer reliance on the availability of ACH services. The business unit assessments will map interdependencies between units that support ACH services. 2. Business continuity test plans will be consistent with the criticality and complexity of the supporting operations, network services and telecommunications and may require coordinated testing with other units, including service providers. 4. ACH Programs and Objectives 1. _On-going Internal ACH Education and Training_ 1. Credit Union will implement the following procedures: Receive the annual ACH Audit and review findings noted. Verify the receipt of the current NACHA Rules and review rule revisions for the current year Provide for regular training of ACH personnel responsible for receipt and origination activities 5. Compliance and Audit 1. Credit Union\u2019s compliance risk management will incorporate applicable policies, procedures and processes for ACH activities, including those conducted through Third-Parties. ACH reviews will be comprehensive and include testing for compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements. 2. Management\u2019s execution of the ACH Risk Management Program will include compliance with the following rules, regulations and laws to determine whether ACH activities remain within legal and CLT established parameters: 1. NACHA Operating Rules & Guidelines - NACHA Rules 2. Bank Secrecy Act / Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML) 3. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) 4. Code of Federal Regulations \u2013 CFR Part 210 (The Green Book) 5. Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circular 4 on ACH items 6. Regulation E \u2013 Electronic Funds Transfer Act 7. Regulation D \u2013 Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions 8. Regulation CC \u2013 Availability of Funds and Collection of Checks 9. Regulation GG\u2014 The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (addendum of non-approved originator types) 10. Uniform Commercial Code Article 4A (UCC 4A) 11. Appropriate state laws 12. Related policies of Credit Union 6. ACH Audit Policy 1. _General Objective and Scope_ \\- The Credit Union or Third party as a subject matter expert will conduct an ACH audit in accordance with all applicable ACH Rules that is defined by the NACHA rules. Compliance with the terms and conditions of this audit policy will be incorporated into the auditing agenda established for ACH processing. 2. _Audit Review_ 1.

Management will present Risk Assessment results to CLT for approval annually. 7. Credit Risk Management 1. Refer to the Commercial Loan Policy. The Credit Union shall develop comprehensive risk analysis procedures to align with Credit Union\u2019s Credit Policy regarding new and on-going Originator relationships, defining specific procedures and processes. 8. High-Risk Activities 1. _General_ 1. Credit Unions that engage in ACH origination with high-risk Originators or that involve Third-Party Senders face increased reputation, credit, transaction and compliance risks. 2. High-risk Originators include companies engaged in potentially illegal activities or have unusually high volume of unauthorized returns. High-risk Originators often initiate transactions through a Third-Party Sender because they have difficulty establishing a relationship directly with a Financial Institution. 3. These operations are inherently riskier and incidents of unauthorized returns are more common with these businesses. The Credit Union addresses this area of high-risk by developing and implementing additional procedures to mitigate that risk. 4. As part of this policy, the following businesses and/or locations and Standard Entry Class (SEC) codes have been identified as high-risk: Add Addendum of non-approved originators by North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Third-Party Senders Non-bank Credit Unions, including Money Services Businesses (MSBs) Offshore corporations Online payments processors Certain credit-repair services Certain mail order and telephone order (MOTO) companies Unlawful online gambling operations Businesses located offshore Adult entertainment businesses Online Payday Lenders IAT \u2013 International ACH Transactions Direct access to ACH Operators for Originators, Third-Party Service Providers or Third-Party Senders 2. _Strategies_ \u2013 A case-by-case analysis and approval is required prior to establishing a business relationship with any individual Originator1 and/or Third-Party Sender identified in the Scope above as High-Risk. 9. Direct Access to the ACH Operator 1. _General_ \u2013 It is the policy of the Credit Union to not permit any Originator, Third-Party Service Provider or Third-Party Sender to prepare and/or transmit files directly to the ACH Operator. 10. ODFI Operational Risk 1. _ACH Origination Products Definitions & Disclosure_ 1. Credit Union will provide origination services for the following Debit and Credit ACH applications. PPD \u2013 Direct Deposit / Direct Payment CCD \u2013 Corporate Credit or Debit 2. _Secure Transmission of ACH Information_ \\- Credit Union will accept ACH information using technologies that provide a commercially reasonable level of security. 3. _Originator due Diligence_ 1. Credit Union defines ACH Origination portfolio requirements as the key components of the Member Identification Policy which includes proper identification of Originators and Third-Party Senders; an analysis of their business, and all required supporting documentation along with: A background check of the customer to validate the legitimacy of the business (if necessary, this check can be supplemented with a background check on the principal business owner of the originator) Evaluation of the customer\u2019s creditworthiness, including a comprehensive financial analysis (like that performed on other potential unsecured borrowers) Refer to Fair Lending Policy Using commercially reasonable methods, assess the nature of the Originator's ACH activity. A summary of documentation requirements, including social security number or tax identification number. Allow the Credit Union to audit Originator and/or Third-Party Sender\u2019s ACH processes and controls at its discretion 4. _Security Procedures_ 1. Security procedures for the acceptance of Files may include, but are not limited to: Security Tokens File confirmation procedures Processing Calendars Other secure methods 5. _Originator File Management_ 1. The Credit Union will perform additional due diligence with respect to ACH origination applications for businesses who have been approved to become members of the Credit Union. 2. The Credit Union shall exercise procedures for all customers considered for ACH origination services. All ACH Originators Third-Party Senders shall be assigned exposure limits based on: Overall customer relationship Individual subsidiaries and/or divisions of the company Historical/predicted dollar amount of files and the specific ACH applications requested 3. Specific procedures for credit underwriting, setting exposure limits, periodic review of exposure limits and monitoring initiated entries and Return activity over multiple settlement dates shall comply with the NACHA Rules. 6. _ODFI/Originator Agreement [and ODFI/Third-party Sender Agreement]_ 1.

The purpose of this policy is to outline the submission and approval process for capital expenditures (purchases), and establish the standard for the recording, capitalizing/depreciating and disposing of capital (fixed) assets. SCOPE Entire Credit Union The scope of this policy is the appropriate approval, and the complete and accurate recording and accounting of all capital (fixed) assets purchases to ensure proper financial reporting. DEFINITIONS A capital expenditure is a purchase of a capital (fixed) asset. Fixed assets include property, leasehold improvements, company vehicles, computer hardware and software, office furniture and fixtures and office equipment acquired in the normal course of business. Fixed assets are expected to have useful lives in excess of three (3) years and are depreciated/capitalized over their useful lives. Capitalization is an accounting method in which a cost is spread out (depreciated) over the useful life of the asset rather than expensed in the period the cost was incurred. The Credit Union has elected to only capitalize a fixed asset with a useful live of at least three (3) years and a value of $10,000 or more; any asset purchased for less than $10,000 will be expensed at the time of purchase. The Capital Expenditure Request form or \"CER\" is the document used to request dollars to be spent by the Credit Union on fixed asset purchases requiring capitalization. These amounts should be included in budget for the upcoming year for the applicable line of business. RESPONSIBILITY 1. Management is responsible to ensure that desired capital expenditures (CERs) are properly approved and submitted for budgeting purposes to Finance. 2. Accounting (A/P) is responsible to ensure that capital expenditures are recorded and accounted for in accordance with GAAP. 3. A/P is responsible to ensure that only capital invoices for approved CERs are paid. 4. The Chief Financial Officer is responsible for the overall implementation of the capital expenditure and fixed asset processes, including management of those responsible for the daily operations of the fixed asset process, the fixed asset computer software system, and capital asset internal controls. 1. Capital Expenditures (Submission and Approval): 1. All capital purchase requirements for the upcoming fiscal year must be submitted as part of the budget process on an approved CER; a CER should not be submitted for less than submitted for less than $10,000. All CERs must be signed by the Requestor and/or cost center (dept) Manager. If the purchase amount requested is $10,000 or more, the Chief Officer of the area or the CEO must sign. All final approved CERs will be kept by the Accounting department. If funds are to be re-allocated to a purchase other than what was approved at budget time, a new CER must be completed and physically signed based on the authorization levels noted above. The re-allocation of funds must be noted in the body of the CER. No invoice payments on a purchase reallocation will be made by A/P without a properly executed CER. There will be times when a capital purchase is needed after the budget has been approved/ outside of the budget timeframe. A CER will need to be completed and approved in accordance with the authorization levels noted above. No invoice payments will be made by A/P for a non-budgeted capital expenditure without a properly executed CER. 2. Capitalization of Fixed Assets: 1. Fixed assets with a useful life of at least three (3) years and a value (cost) of $10,000 or greater will be capitalized. Generally, purchases of items less than $10,000 will be expensed, though there can be exceptions to this which will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Note: Purchases under $10,000 made in conjunction with a major project may be considered for capitalization as part of the project. 2. All Credit Union fixed assets will be depreciated on a straight-line method, based on MACRS useful lives; see Resources/References section 9 below for details. 1. Property will be stated at cost unless there has been a permanent loss in value that should be reflected in the capital asset account. 2. The fixed asset value will include costs related to acquisition, including Freight costs, Installation costs and Vendor consulting costs. 3. The Credit Union's fixed asset accounts and depreciation schedules will be reconciled monthly. 4. Only capital assets that are in use or that have been principally paid for and are to be placed in use within a period of 1 to 2 months shall be depreciated. Capital assets billed in segments to be placed in service later shall be held as \"In Process\". 3. Asset Dispositions: 1. Assets can be disposed of in various ways: retired, sold, traded-in, or scrapped (due to damage or obsolescence). An asset that is disposed of shall be removed from the Credit Union's records, with an appropriate charge recorded to gain (loss) on disposal of capital assets. The disposition of a fixed asset must be approved by the department's senior management; it then needs to be reported to Accounting in order to update the applicable fixed asset record and corresponding general ledger accounts. Management will complete the Asset Disposal form with the proper approval and submit to the Accounting department through email, using the fixedassets@americu.org email address. The Asset Disposal form can be found in KnowledgeBase as a related item to this policy. 4. Asset Transfers : 1. The transfer of fixed assets between departments, divisions or business units should have no impact on their net book value. All assets are transferred at their net book value with no recognition of gains or losses by the department transferring the asset. A change in a capital asset's location or ownership occurs when: A capital asset is moved to another office or building even if the ownership remains the same. A capital asset is transferred to another department even if the location remains the same. A capital asset is transferred to another primary user even if the location and/or department remains the same. 2. Interdepartmental transfers of assets will be reported to the Accounting department in writing, including the description, serial number and the name of the department to receive the property. The department manager to whom the item was assigned originally will be held accountable until the fixed asset department is notified of the transfer. After being notified, the department manager acquiring the property assumes responsibility. All costs associated with the transfer will be expensed. 5. Asset Useful Lives: 1. Under _Generally Accepted Accounting Principles_ (GAAP), the cost of fixed assets should be depreciated and charged to expense over the estimated time that the asset will be in use. AmeriCU has adopted the IRS MACRS Property Depreciation Schedule. Fixed asset purchases with a cost of $10,000 or more shall be capitalized and depreciated according to the schedule below: (Salvage Values will be defaulted to $1.00) Asset | Useful life | Salvage value ---|---|--- Software generated for internal use | 3 years | $1.00 ATM \u2013 offsite (convenience stores) | 3 years | $1.00 Personal computers, peripherals | 3 years | $1.00 ATM \u2013 branch locations | 5 years | $1.00 Kiosk machines | 5 years | $1.00 Company vehicles | 5 years | 20% PC and \"off the shelf\" software | 5 years | $1.00 Office equipment (copiers, etc.) | 5 years | $1.00 Furniture (desks, chairs, tables, etc.) | 7 years | $1.00 Other equipment & fixtures | 7 years | $1.00 Building improvements | 10-15 years | None Banking equipment | 15 years | $1.00 Leasehold improvements | Remaining lease term; renewals 15 years | Buildings & Building Improvements | 39 years | 30% Items of equipment which are an integral part of the building, or are extraordinarily long lived, may be included in, and depreciated as cost of the building. 6. Fixed Asset identification and inventory: 1. Accounting will ensure that any fixed asset will be identified by a unique \"tag\" number; this will either be an actual AmeriCU Credit Union pre-numbered inventory tag placed on the fixed asset or an internal number based on a formatting determined by Accounting. Each tag number will be recorded in BankTel for reporting and record-keeping purposes. Fixed assets which can be physically tagged (such as coin machines or cash recyclers) will be identified and location determined; tags will be sent to the employee responsible for the indicated department/location. Once tags have been placed, the corresponding tag number will be communicated to Accounting for recording in the fixed asset platform BankTel. 2. As a new fixed asset is purchased and placed into service, Accounting will determine the appropriate identifying number and will ensure the fixed asset is properly tagged. All information will be recorded in BankTel. 3. Annually, Accounting will generate a report of fixed assets with identifying numbers assigned. Lists will be sent to each department/location manager for verification that the asset is still in use. Accounting will perform a reconciliation of inventory identifying numbers to the fixed asset listing to ensure all identified fixed assets are in service. 4. NOTE: Accounting may determine that not all fixed assets in each location need to be inventoried, depending on type of asset and net value. Assets with physical tags and with a net value over a determined threshold, as well as vehicles, will be inventoried.

This Liquidity and Contingency Funding Plan Policy of AmeriCU Credit Union (\u201cCredit Union\u201d) sets forth policies, procedures, and guidelines to follow in the management of the Credit Union\u2019s liquidity position. The Board of Directors (\u201cBOD\u201d) approves the contents of this Policy that management and the Asset-Liability Management Committee (\u201cALCO\u201d) will follow. This Policy will be used during periods of normal day-to-day liquidity and when under liquidity pressures that the Credit Union may face. The intent of this Policy is to provide guidelines management will follow in the day-to-day liquidity management process. The objectives include: Developing an overall liquidity strategy Defining the lines of responsibility and identifying those responsible for managing and monitoring liquidity risk Establishing acceptable methods of monitoring and measuring the liquidity needs of the Credit Union Establishing and defining control procedures to ensure adherence to policies and procedures SCOPE All AmeriCU Employees DEFINITIONS Liquidity is the availability of funds, or assurance that funds will be available, to honor all cash outflow commitments as they come due. The objective of this Policy is to provide a framework to minimize the possibility of any adverse effects of a significant and sustained liquidity crisis that results in the inability to meet operating cash needs and commitments. Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to obtain funds at a reasonable price within a reasonable timeframe to meet financial commitments when due. Liquidity problems can result from the following: Changing economic or interest rate conditions Unexpected and significant deposit outflows Intense competition on savings products Investments such as callable bonds extending when interest rates rise Unusually strong loan demand An international crisis Significant financial events or market imbalance Reputation risk including but not limited to adverse publicity from severe loan losses, or any other factors that can deplete the liquidity of the Credit Union. RESPONSIBILITY At least annually, the ALCO and BOD will review and approve Policy statement edits. The BOD delegates decision-making authority to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) to conduct routine, day-to-day liquidity and cash management activities. However, liquidity management problems that extend beyond routine, day-to-day operations will involve consultation with the ALCO. A Contingency Funding Plan (CFP) incorporated into this Policy is for use in the unlikely event of a severe liquidity crisis occurs. 1. _Liquidity Management Strategies_ 1. The Credit Union recognizes the importance of liquidity planning. In the event of sustained liquidity pressure, the various strategies outlined in this section may receive an increased level of consideration by Management and the ALCO. The BOD recognizes that some of these strategies are preventative with implementation prior to the onset of a crisis. Other strategies are reactive with implementation immediately. The strategies will differ in terms of the implementation time, costs, risks, financial implications, and regulatory consequences. 2. The day-to-day overall liquidity management process uses both asset-based and liability-based principles although members' core deposits are preferred whenever they are available at a reasonable cost. In those circumstances where wholesale funding or borrowings from other financial institutions offers a maturity, size, cost or timely execution that is not available with member deposits, the Credit Union would evaluate and consider using wholesale funding sources as a strategy subject to the constraints of this Policy. 3. The Credit union will also review the implications on liquidity and the liquidity risk management strategies listed below when considering new strategies, products and services. 4. The strategies include the following. 1. _Asset Liability Management (ALM) Position_ 1. The most important liquidity management strategy is a sound ALM position. The Credit Union demonstrates such a position by the ability to increase dividend rates commensurate with the market to minimize deposit outflows without significantly impairing the fundamental earning power of the Credit Union. Income simulation risk management guidelines in the ALM/IRR Policy when considering rising rate shock tests demonstrates this ability. 2. _Monitoring Loan Rates and Loans-to-Assets Ratio_ 1. Although one of the primary roles of the Credit Union is to make loans to its members, Management will review and adjust loan rates as necessary if the liquidity of the Credit Union requires such pricing adjustments. 2. Loan demand that exceeds the runoff of existing loans could contribute to a liquidity problem if the loans-to-assets ratio is already high. Accordingly, Management will monitor the net volume of new loans relative to the projected runoff of existing loans. 3. _Monitoring of Liquidity Profile_ Management will review the liquidity profile by monitoring the following: 1. Cash and overnight investment account balances as well as other short-term investments. 2. Investment maturities, amortizations, and those with a higher probability of prepayment. 3. Loan payments and maturities as well as the loan pipeline report. 4. Loans held for sale pipeline. 5. Short-term borrowing capacity. 6. Deposit outflows or the extent to which the Credit Union retains deposits and maturing time deposits. 7. Operating expense outflows. 8. Short-term borrowing maturities. 2. _Monitoring Money Market Accounts (MMA) and Certificate Rates_ Management must monitor and adjust offering rates on the MMA and Certificate of Deposits (Share Certificates) to remain competitive in the local and national markets and to control asset growth. MMA can be volatile in a rising rate environment particularly if the rates do not remain competitive to retain those deposits. 3. _Certificate of Deposit Special Offerings_ 1. An integral part of a sound ALM position is a sizable ladder of member share certificates with sufficient early withdrawal penalties. A well-laddered member share certificate program with maturities extending out to four or five years is a preventative strategy. Share certificates with terms longer than five years can be offered as well (e.g. in a strategy to maintain longer-term mortgages on the books). 2. In response to a liquidity pressure, management may offer certificates to members at rates that are above market as a \u201cspecial\u201d. If offered, such specials would be for a limited time so management can stop the special when the desired amount of funds reach or exceed expectations. 3. To minimize the potential risk of future liquidity problems, such specials would be for various terms rather than concentrated in one maturity timeframe. As with any term certificates, adequate early withdrawal penalties should exist for certificate specials. 4. _Non-Member Brokered Shares_ An alternative to member certificate specials is the use of the brokered market and raising funds through offering non-member share certificates. Management may offer certificate rates above market to drive funding but typically pursues this source of funding when the cost of funding is lower than other primary and secondary funding sources. Management monitors non- member share balances against regulatory requirements to ensure compliance with guidelines and policies. 5. _Investment Portfolio Management_ 1. The primary role of the investment portfolio is to provide liquidity by means of a laddered structure or maturity schedule with predictable cash flows. Management will maintain a structure that reflects a balance between the size of the portfolio, the overall ALM position, and income needs. Generally, a smaller portfolio will emphasize liquidity by means of a shorter-term ladder whereas a larger portfolio relative to total assets will emphasize both liquidity with predictable cash flows and income using longer-term maturities. 2. The sale of investment securities is a reactive strategy for liquidity purposes. Assuring that the portfolio of investment securities is of high quality is the best insurance to be able to provide liquidity if needed. The extent to which the Credit Union potentially sells securities to meet liquidity needs depends on the accounting classification and the amount of market losses resulting from the sale. 3. Having an \u201cavailable for sale\u201d (AFS) investment classification provides management the greatest flexibility to sell a security when needed and removes market valuation volatility from operating income. The BOD and Management recognize that liquidity problems could exist during periods where market conditions depress bond prices and the sale of investments could result in realized losses. 4. Management will determine and review on a regular basis what percentage of the investment portfolio should be in readily liquid and available for pledging to secure borrowing at any point in time. 6. _Borrowing Power_ 1. AmeriCU believes that borrowing for the credit union is appropriate when done strategically as part of overall asset and liability management. Short-term borrowing from Alloya Corporate Federal Credit Union, the Federal Home Loan Bank, the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window or other sources may be used to complement routine cash management activities or in the early stages of an emerging liquidity problem. However, the BOD recognizes that funding a liquidity crisis with short-term borrowings may increase interest rate risk because such borrowings reprice on short notice, even daily. 2. When expectations exist for a sizable borrowing need that may be long-term and market conditions and rates are favorable, Management will consider longer term funding sources rather than overnight borrowings to diversify the borrowings over time. 3. For a liquidity crisis, a separate Contingency Funding Plan (CFP) is below. It is understood that having unused borrowing power and sufficient unencumbered assets that can be pledged as collateral in a crisis are critical. 7. _Mortgage Loan and Loan Participation Sales_ 1. Although mortgage loan and loan participation sales are a liquidity strategy, Management will first evaluate and use other cost-effective strategies noted above for liquidity purposes. Loan sales are a consideration that needs comprehensive evaluation when the Credit Union foresees sustained liquidity and/or earnings pressures. 2. Management recognizes that liquidity pressures can occur during a rising rate environment. That rate environment may cause significant market losses on mortgage loans or necessitate discounts on other loan sales. The sale of existing loans in the portfolio in reaction to a liquidity crisis may not be an effective strategy because of the realization of such losses. 8. GUIDELINES AND LIMITS The nature of a liquidity crisis is such that external factors are beyond the control of Management. In such situations, the Contingency Funding Plan below will become the governing liquidity management document until the crisis subsides. In normal liquidity conditions, the following liquidity guidelines exist: 1. The Credit Union\u2019s ALM position should be in compliance with the risk guidelines and ratios specified in the ALM Policy. 2. Loan and deposit rates should adjust to remain competitive in the local and, if necessary, national markets, as determined by the Pricing Committee. 3. Limits will be established and monitored through \u201cliquidity indicators\u201d that consist of key ratio metrics. 9. MONITORING POLICY COMPLIANCE 1. For monitoring purposes, Finance staff review, monitor, and reconcile cash accounts on a daily basis and project monthly funding needs of the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) account, which is the Credit Union\u2019s primary operating account. Cash and short-term investments, to be maintained for operating needs and potential unexpected funding requirements, will be targeted to be 2% or more of total assets at the discretion of the CEO and/or the CFO. If the projection shows that at any time the balance in the account will fall below requirements, the CFO develops appropriate action plans to include the possible transfer of cash from one of the available sources to the Federal Reserve Bank. 2. If it is determined that liquidity sources are projected to be less than required by Policy, the CFO will review options in order to arrange adequate cash coverage. This could include placing a moratorium on the purchase of longer-term investments, arranging for term credit from a borrowing facility with a repayment plan, and/or arranging for the possible sale of investments available for sale or other assets to meet cash flow needs. Economic conditions at the time will determine the priorities for such a plan the CEO and CFO implement. In the event that a contingency plan needs development, the CFO will prepare cash flow projections for discussion with the CEO, ALCO, and the BOD as necessary. 3. The Credit Union will develop and implement a monthly projection of liquidity sources and uses of funds with appropriate thresholds/triggers in order to establish baseline projections of cash flow needs. The Credit Union will also provide a rolling, 90-day short term liquidity forecast to Management at biweekly Pricing Committee meetings and at the quarterly ALCO meetings. Any projected funding needs will be determined and appropriate actions discussed at these meetings with actions taken including but not limited to curtailment of investment security purchases and arranging for advances with the Federal Home Loan Bank. 4. Quarterly, Management will monitor the following ratios as liquidity indicators: DESCRIPTION | LOW RISK | MODERATE RISK | HIGH RISK | VERY HIGH RISK ---|---|---|---|--- Cash & Short-term Investments to Total Assets | >4% | 3%-4% | 2%-3% | <2% Cash & Short-term Investment to Total Shares | >4% | 3%-4% | 2%-3% | <2% Cash & Short-term Investments to Contingent Liabilities | 25% | 20% | 15% | 10% Net Deposit Outflows - 1 month to Total Shares | -1.90% | -2.00% | -2.30% | -2.45% Net Deposit Outflows - 3 months to Total Shares | -2.20% | -3.20% | -4.35% | <-4.35% Net Loan Growth (3 months) to Cash & Short-term Investments | 35% | 40% | 45% | 50% Gross Loans to Shares Ratio | <90% | 90%-95% | 95%-100% | >100% % of Borrowing Lines Available | >75% | 50%-75% | 25%-50% | <25% Non Member Shares/Total Shares | <10% | 10%-15% | 15%-20% | >20% 5. Management and ALCO will monitor the indicated ratios as well as other relevant information to assess the liquidity position. Monthly reporting to the BOD will include current period ratios and historical trends. The Credit Union will monitor on an ongoing basis net worth levels and the effect and impact that might have on liquidity. Management will report actual and projected significant changes in the liquidity position to the BOD along with strategies designed to minimize the liquidity problems as applicable. 6. Significant changes include but are not limited to a projected change to high risk or very high risk for any indicator noted above during the same period. 7. Management will implement a risk \u201cheat map\u201d to show how many indicators are a concern. In addition, Management will monitor the minimum cash and short-term investments to total shares ratio for any change in status from low to moderate to high/very high risk regardless of whether the average ratios warrant such change in status. 8. For the ratios monitored above, when the risk rating results in \u201clow risk\", it is determined that the credit union has sufficient liquidity for normal operations and no special action is required. For a rating of \u201cmoderate risk\u201d for two consecutive quarters, management will report to ALCO at the next scheduled meeting. If any ratios measure \u201chigh risk\u201d for two consecutive quarters or \u201cvery high risk\u201d during any quarter, weekly liquidity updates and cash flow forecasts will be provided by the CFO to the CEO and EVP. Reporting to ALCO and the BOD with corrective action strategies defined and regular monthly updates will be communicated until Management and the BOD determines the risk has been mitigated. Corrective action strategies include, but are not limited to, the sale of loans or investments, increase loan or deposit rates, accessing borrowing lines, and seeking non member deposits. Updates and corrective actions shall continue until all risk rating results are \"high risk\" or lower. 9. Management and ALCO will review various liquidity forecasts using stress testing environments. The results of the stress tests will be reviewed by ALCO on a quarterly basis and will provide Management and ALCO insight into longer term liquidity excesses or shortfalls. The stress testing scenarios should be for 12 months and include, but not be limited to: interest rate shocks, non-maturity deposit runoffs of various levels, increase in loan demand, increased utilization of unfunded commitments. 10. Contingency Funding Plan 1. The BOD and Management of the Credit Union recognize the importance of liquidity in the day-to-day operation of a financial institution. Accordingly, it is crucial to have a Contingency Funding Plan (CFP) that expands management and ALCO\u2019s latitude in dealing with and quickly addressing liquidity in times of crisis. 2. The CFP becomes active only during an actual or projected liquidity crisis as defined by indicators noted above. Such crises have a low probability of occurring but they can have serious effects on a financial institution\u2019s safety and soundness when they do occur. Internal and/or external events cause such crises. 11. Objective 1. A primary objective of this CFP is to provide a managerial framework to cope with a severe liquidity crisis and maintain core operations during such a period. 2. In 2010, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) issued expectations for liquidity risk management. The importance of cash flow projections, maintaining diversified funding sources, maintaining a cushion of unencumbered liquid assets and having a CFP were suggested tools for measuring and managing liquidity. 12. CFP Execution in a Crisis 1. The Credit Union recognizes the possible need for funding that goes beyond its most important sources, deposit growth. For this reason, the Credit Union has created a funding program that identifies various wholesale funding sources to use in an emergency. Maintaining unused borrowing power is critical so that in a liquidity crisis such borrowings are available. The Credit Union will maintain collateral and/or lines of credit with Alloya Corporate Federal Credit Union, the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. 2. For purposes of this CFP in periods of liquidity crises, Management and the BOD will adhere to a maximum limit of 50% of Shares and Net Worth from funding sources. Regulation 12 CFR 741.2, Maximum Borrowing Authority, states the following: 1. _Any Credit Union which makes application for insurance of its accounts pursuant to Title II of the Act, or any insured credit union, must not borrow, from any source, an aggregate amount in excess of 50 percent of its paid-in and unimpaired capital and surplus (shares and undivided earnings, plus net income or minus net loss)._ 3. Management should periodically test the various sources of liquidity on at least an annual basis. The capacity to reach any of the above percentages are subject to the availability of collateral as well as the ability of those sources to lend at any given time. The above limits do not imply that the Credit Union must have that much borrowing power available at any given time. 4. Borrowing terms, structures and collateral requirements by the funding sources shown above are subject to change and will be evaluated, analyzed, and compared to other alternative sources at the time such a funding need exists. 5. The CFP limits may only be used during a liquidity crisis and while the Credit Union is recovering from such a crisis. Management and/or ALCO will notify the BOD when the CFP warrants use in the early stage of a crisis. 13. _Borrowing Structure_ The borrowing structure in a liquidity crisis will depend on the interest rate environment, the anticipated severity and duration of the crisis, the relative borrowing costs, and the availability of collateral and funding structures available at the time. The maximum maturity of crisis-related borrowings will typically be one year for a short-term crisis. This structure would leave the balance sheet in a position that management could quickly repay the borrowings once the crisis has passed or restructured once the crisis has stabilized. Management will assess the liquidity crisis, weigh these considerations and attempt to diversify the funding sources and maturity structure of the borrowings if it appears that significant borrowings will be on going for an extended period. 14. _Role of Securities Portfolio_ US Treasuries and agency-backed securities along with high quality first and second mortgages could be collateral for borrowings. Management may elect to sell for liquidity Treasury and Agency securities that are free of collateral pledge; depending on their structure and the rate environment, losses may occur. The potential sale of Available for Sale (AFS) securities is an asset- based approach to a liquidity crisis and any sale will be determined based on the funding need and potential duration of a liquidity crisis. 15. _Crisis Events_ A liquidity crisis can be short- or long-term and caused by internal or external events. Liquidity crises may involve adverse publicity from large on- going loan or investment losses or fraud, adverse economic conditions, concentration risk problems, improper controls or poor decisions, local weather-related disasters such as hurricanes, tornados, or floods, or acts of war including terrorism resulting in significant deposit outflows. 16. _Short-Term Crisis_ 1. The most likely scenario necessitating a need for liquidity in a short-term crisis would be the result of a sizeable withdrawal of shares over such a short timeframe. Immediate liquid assets and/or existing borrowing commitments would have to address a \u201crun\u201d on shares crisis. Another short-term crisis is disintermediation where a significant rise in market share rates drive withdrawal and placement to those higher paying share products. The Credit Union monitors for this member behavior to ensure sufficient liquid funds are available. A third short-term scenario is a material drawdown of member unfunded commitments (i.e., open lines of credit approved not used). 2. The plan in a short-term crisis would be to replenish liquidity through Federal Home Loan Bank Advances and Federal Reserve Discount Window borrowings pending placement of sufficient pledged collateral. Availability, price efficiency, and maturity will determine the order in which the Credit Union will use short-term funding sources. 17. _Long-Term Crisis_ While predicting a long-term crisis from a short-term emergency need is difficult, monitoring short-term liquidity needs and effectively addressing concerns will assist management in preventing a long-term crisis from evolving. 18. _Compliance and Reporting_ In a liquidity crisis, management will analyze the costs and tradeoffs of liquidity strategies. If an event activates this CFP, the CFO will report liquidity status and cash flow forecasts to the CEO and other executives. Also, ALCO will report the status of the crisis and CFP strategies to the BOD monthly or more frequently as necessary. During a liquidity crisis, management will provide the BOD the following information: 1. Crisis Management and Action Plan Update; 2. Liquidity Statistics Summary; 3. Liquidity Report (sources/uses projection); 4. Financial Statements and related forecasts. 19. The CEO and/or CFO will inform the BOD Chairman of any material decisions as soon as practical. 20. ALCO and the BOD will review this policy statement at least annually. 21. POLICY EXCEPTIONS 1. Excessive liquidity risk can severely affect the financial condition of the Credit Union. High liquidity risk and the need for immediate or short-term funding could result in significant additive expense stressing net worth. Credit Union officials and the CEO share the responsibility to identify, manage, monitor and control liquidity risk. Understanding, limiting, and mitigating liquidity risk is the focus of this policy statement. 2. Any exception to this policy will first be discussed with the CEO and presented to ALCO at its next regularly scheduled meeting. In addition, exceptions and potential corrective actions will be disclosed to the BOD at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 22. APPENDIX A - Ratio Definitions 1. Cash & Short-term Investments to Total Assets: Maintaining a certain level of marketable securities in relation to assets provides a cushion for funding share out flows without the need to liquidate assets or draw from lines. 2. Cash & Short-term Investments to Total Shares: Maintaining a certain level of marketable securities in relation to shares provides a cushion for funding share out flows without the need to liquidate investments or draw from lines. 3. Cash & Short-term Investments to Contingent Liabilities: total cash and short-term investments divided by unused commitments to members. Focus is on the ability to meet potential commitments such as unfunded lines of credit to members. The higher the ratio the lower likelihood of liquidity risk where alternative funding sources may be used. 4. Net Deposit Outflows \u2013 1 month and 3 months \u2013 to Total Shares: the change in total deposit balances month over month and quarter over quarter as a percentage of total shares. Focus is on the potential impact of higher deposit outflows than prior month and quarter. A monitoring mechanism to assess member behavior in the short term and to determine the potential impact or consideration for a \u201crun\u201d on deposits. 5. Net Loan Growth (3 months) to Cash & Short-term Investments: month-to-month change in net loans as compared to total cash and short-term investments. Focus is on the Credit Union\u2019s ability to meet loan growth with liquid assets. The higher the ratio the greater demand on liquidity and the potential for alternative funding sources. 6. Gross Loans to Shares: total gross loans divided by total shares. Focus is on the ability to fund loans from member shares. The higher the ratio the greater likelihood of higher liquidity risk and the need for funding from external sources.

The framework and philosophy herein provide direction in decisions regarding investments, loans, deposits, and borrowings. Specifically, those earning assets that affect Net Interest Income (NII) and Net Economic Value (NEV). Implementation of this policy assists management in maintaining a balance between loans and deposits, minimizing expenses, managing risk and sustaining adequate levels of liquidity and capital. The goal of this policy is to establish formal review and decision-making procedures to maintain sufficient earnings, regardless of changes in interest rates, while managing all types of risk noted below. Earnings should be sufficient to maintain adequate levels of capital. It is primarily through earnings that the credit union can maintain the levels of capital necessary to sustain member service and asset growth. This policy supplements the investment, liquidity and lending policies. Additional objectives of ALM include but are not limited to the following: Provide for management and BOD awareness of the credit union\u2019s interest rate risk Measure the effect of balance sheet changes related to the asset and liability composition Select strategies that optimize earnings growth to maintain sufficient net worth levels Manage and monitor interest rates, net interest income, operating margins, and liquidity requirements to formulate investment and asset/liability management strategic initiatives Establish effective loan and share pricing strategies in conjunction with Pricing Committee Assess and model new product and service initiatives that meet the needs of members and provide beneficial ALM impact To establish BOD approved interest rate risk limits relative to changes in net interest income (NII) and net economic value (NEV). SCOPE All AmeriCU Employees DEFINITIONS N/A RESPONSIBILITY 1. The BOD is ultimately responsible for the ALM practices of the Credit Union. The BOD delegates monitoring of this policy to the Asset Liability Committee (ALCO). 2. The Board delegates operational authority for ALM to the President/CEO who, with advice from the ALCO and the CFO, will make day-to-day ALM decisions in accordance with this policy, while considering the other policies, goals and plans approved by the BOD. 3. The BOD and CEO, pursuant to this policy, has charged the ALCO with the responsibility of implementing internal ALM decision-making mechanisms, as well as communications and control procedures that can be used to aid in the management of earnings and risk. These mechanisms and procedures will guide the Credit Union\u2019s liquidity, capital planning, asset mix, liability mix and pricing policies. 4. ALCO members include: BOD Vice Chairman; BOD Chief Financial Officer; Chief Executive Officer; Chief Financial Officer; Chief Lending Officer; Chief Risk Officer; Manager, Financial Reporting & Analysis; and, Senior Financial Analyst 5. The ALCO chairperson is the Credit Union Chief Financial Officer (CFO) who is responsible for facilitating the ALCO meetings and overseeing the ALM program. 6. ALCO meets quarterly to review and make decisions for the prospective quarter and subsequent periods based on the following information: Prior ALCO meeting minutes Local/national economic conditions and interest rate forecast Financial statements and performance ratios Investment portfolio mix, market values, maturities, and projected cash flows Loan portfolio mix, credit quality, and pricing strategies Deposit mix, maturities and retention Allowance for loan losses Net worth, capital adequacy, and risk-based net worth projections Liquidity position Concentration risk limit assessments Interest rate risk analysis based on net economic value (NEV) and net interest income (NII) simulations Relevant financial policy statements and related annual updates/edits ALM Policy Investment Policy (separate Investment Committee oversight) Liquidity and Contingency Funding Plan Policy Dividend Policy Concentration Risk Policy Loan Participation Policy Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Policy Sale of Non-Deposit Investment Products (Wealth Management) 7. Emphasis is placed on quarterly NEV and NII simulations and related \u201cwhat-if\u201d scenarios to assist in the planning and forecasting processes within the credit union. Noted above and other relevant information will be presented as warranted. 8. ALCO members are required to obtain annual training on relevant ALM topics of related learning material. Each member must maintain evidence of training in order to satisfy regulatory expectations prior to annual examinations. Examples of training include but are not limited to the following: ALCO meetings that include education of terms, balance sheet changes, income statement impacts, and other concepts Webinars, seminars, and training presentations related to interest rate risk, investments, loans, and shares or deposit studies such as non-maturity analysis Related readings that discuss balance sheet and income statement analysis, financial analysis of a balance sheet, fair market value and interest rate movements, rate environments, and \u201cshock\u201d analysis 9. Following is a list of some of the significant types of risk that could potentially affect the total level of risk exposure to the Credit Union's financial position. This list is for illustrative purposes and is not all-inclusive of the risks faced by the Credit Union. Interest Rate risk is the risk caused by changes in market interest rates that may adversely impact financial performance. Price risk also called Valuation or Market Risk is the risk that changes in interest rates may adversely affect the market value of assets, and liabilities resulting in a lower market value of capital. Liquidity risk is the risk that loan and deposit withdrawal demands will exceed the availability of liquid assets thereby requiring the Credit Union to sell non-current assets, potentially at a loss, or borrow funds and incur additional interest costs. Credit risk is the risk that the quality of the loan portfolio will be impaired, either through deficient loan underwriting standards or other factors, resulting in significant loan losses. Default risk is the risk of loss on an investment due to the inability of an issuer to meet contractual obligations for repayment of principal and interest. Concentration risk is associated with the concentration of loans to a particular member or member group and/or inadequate diversification of the investment portfolio. Call risk or prepayment is the risk that funds will be returned before they are expected, particularly in the case of prepayments on mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities, forcing the Credit Union to reinvest at lower rates or carry excess liquidity, which would reduce net interest margin. Custody risk is the risk that investments held for safekeeping by others are not held as intended exposing the Credit Union to possible loss. 10. It is the guiding philosophy of the Credit Union to control these risks while pursuing acceptable methods of achieving maximum yields from earning assets. This allows the Credit Union to provide competitive dividends to members on deposits and interest rates on loans. 11. GUIDANCE AND LIMITS All policies and practices governing ALM shall be in full compliance with regulatory guidelines, state, and federal laws, rules, and regulations. The BOD recognizes that insight and expertise are important in ALM and therefore, policy exceptions may be necessary from time to time. In such instances, the CEO will use their best judgment in assessing the magnitude of the policy exception. The BOD shall approve any significant deviations from this policy. Quarterly, subsequent to the ALCO meeting, the ALCO chairperson will provide to the BOD a summary of ALM results and future quarter expectations based on forecasted results. _ALM Risk Management Framework_ The Credit Union uses two model frameworks to support its ALM and interest rate risk monitoring. Both ALM models measure the institution\u2019s sensitivity to changes in interest rates through Net Interest Income (NII) Analysis and Net Economic Value (NEV) Analysis. An internal model built within Profit Stars, which is the Credit Union\u2019s budgeting and profitability application, provides for internal modeling and \u201cwhat-if\u201d scenario planning. These internal tools provide analytical support for monthly and scenario planning to drive directional decision-making. Resulting NII and NEV analysis are based on a static balance sheet using year to date actual results along with subsequent period budget and forecast estimates for the annual period. ALM First, in a consultative capacity, provides the Credit Union ALM modeling services and related quarterly reporting. This ALM reporting is the primary source and model for the Credit Union\u2019s ALM results. The ALM analysis measures the institution\u2019s sensitivity to changes in interest rates expressed as future earnings or NII analysis and in current economic value or NEV analysis. ALM First uses ZMdesk software from ZM Financial Systems to perform the ALM analysis. _Net Interest Income (NII) Analysis_ For NII simulations, the Credit Union uses a constant balance sheet. Matured, called, or paid down principal balances are reinvested into like instruments based on original term. Reinvested balances earn the institution\u2019s projected offer rates. Market interest rates and rates that drive the projection of offer rates are projected according to implied forward rates. The Credit Union analyzes NII over scenarios in which interest rates increase and decrease 25 basis points per month for twelve months and when interest rates increase and decrease immediately by 300 basis points. Rate changes associated with scenarios are applied on top of implied forward rates. For example, if 1-month LIBOR is projected to increase 100 basis points over the next year in accordance with implied forward rates, it would increase 400 basis points over the year in both the shock up 300 scenario and the ramp up 300 scenario. Policy Limits: Net interest income should not decline more than 25% from the base scenario in the following interest rate environments: NII rising 25 basis points (bps) per month for twelve to twenty four months (ramp up 300bps) NII declining 25bps per month for twelve to twenty four months (ramp down 300bps) NII shock up 300bps (immediate 300bps increase) for twelve months NII shock down 300bps (immediate 300bps decrease) for twelve months _Net Economic Value (NEV)_ NEV is the market value of assets less the market value of liabilities. The Credit Union calculates economic value assuming immediate, parallel changes in the term structure of interest rates. Scenarios include down 300 basis points through up 300 basis points in 100-basis-point increments with rates floored at 0%. The credit quality of loans is accounted for only by reducing the economic value of assets by the allowance for loan losses. Therefore, the value reported in the base scenario does not represent a \u201cmarket\u201d value, which would account for projected credit losses. Instead, the base value represents only an economic value that reflects the interest income or expense differential between the instrument\u2019s interest rate and the market interest rate. The Credit Union does not apply an intangible or franchise value to any instruments on the balance sheet. Moreover, spreads are constant in all scenarios. Policy Limits: ALCO will assess equity at risk by using -300 and +300 basis point immediate and instantaneous shocks. The net economic value should not decline more than 50% in a -300 or +300 basis point shock. In addition, the minimum post-shock NEV in the same scenarios (-300 and +300 bps immediate/instantaneous shock) should not fall below 5%. _ALM Model Back Testing_ The ALM Model shall be back tested twice per year, with the results of the back test being shared with the ALCO committee upon completion. The purpose of the back test to ensure model assumptions under various rate environments are accurate. _NCUA Supervisory Test_ ALCO will review the results of the NCUA Supervisory Test on a quarterly basis. Management strives to maintain Supervisory test results for the post shock and sensitivity limits within the Low or Moderate risk classifications as prescribed by the NCUA. Management will discuss results that fall into the \"High\" risk classification and will compare the results of the supervisory test to the internal NEV reporting and adherence to policy limits and tolerances. Risk mitigation strategies as documented below in MONITORING POLICY COMPLIANCE may be considered based on the combination of Supervisory test results and internal NEV reporting and will be discussed with the ALCO. _New Products/Business Initiatives_ New products or business initiatives should be fully analyzed to understand the impact they may have on on interest rate risk. The new product or initiative should be included in the analyses listed above prior to implementation. The results of the analyses including the new product or initiative should remain within the policy limits listed above. _Non -Maturity Deposits_ Non- Maturity Deposits (NMD) are a large part of the balance sheet and understanding their behavior is a key part in the NII and NEV measurements. Management will obtain an updated NMD study on at least an annual basis. The results of these studies will be shared with ALCO at the next scheduled meeting and incorporated into the forecasts. 12. MONITORING POLICY COMPLIANCE If NII and NEV results exceed policy limits stated above in the applicable rate environments above for one quarter, ALCO will consider an early warning trigger. The ALCO will inform the Board at the next scheduled monthly Board meeting that NII and/or NEV results are out of policy, and begin to implement corrective actions to include but not limited to the following: Review ALM model assumptions to determine reasonableness based on current economic conditions Assess and determine modifications to the balance sheet composition Purchase or sell assets Incur or pay-off liabilities Change loan and deposit volume targets Effect pricing decisions to drive needed member behavior Change the composition of the investment portfolio Document justification for taking no corrective action and communicate with BOD ALCO will work with Finance to create \u201cwhat-if\u201d scenarios on the corrective actions to assess the reasonableness corrective actions will have to bring the Credit Union back in compliance with the interest rate risk limits. The credit unions NII and/or NEV shall be brought back within policy limits within two quarters after the triggering event. The ALCO chairperson will provide monthly updates to the BOD until the Credit Union is in compliance. _Model Validation_ Every three years, the Credit Union will contract with an independent third party to perform model validation of ALM First. The results of the validation, any findings and needed remediations will be presented to ALCO at the next scheduled meeting following the receipt of the report. ALCO and the BOD will review this policy at least annually. 13. POLICY EXCEPTION Excessive interest rate risk can severely affect the financial condition of the Credit Union. Ineffective monitoring and management of ALM could result in significant exposures and foregone interest income that could stress earnings and net worth. Credit Union officials and the CEO share the responsibility to identify, manage, monitor and control interest rate risk. Understanding, limiting, and mitigating interest rate risk through effective ALM is the focus of this policy statement. Any exception to this policy statement will be discussed with the CEO and addressed with ALCO. In addition, disclosure of the exception and potential corrective actions will be presented to the BOD at its next regularly scheduled meeting.

It is the policy of AmeriCU Credit Union to comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and sound business practices in any credit union-related sale of mutual funds, annuities or other non-deposit investments. AmeriCU Credit Union must have a written agreement with any entity involved in credit union-related sales and services of non-deposit investment products that outlines the duties and responsibilities of each party. The agreement must specify that such entities will comply with all applicable requirements, including those in this letter. The Credit Union will make it clear to other entities that the management of the Credit Union, and appropriate regulators, will be verifying such compliance. The governing agreement must include provisions regarding Credit Union oversight and examiner access to related records. SCOPE All AmeriCU Employees DEFINITIONS N/A RESPONSIBILITY 1. The Credit Union\u2019s Board of Directors is responsible for evaluating the risks posed by these sales activities, and is required to adopt policies and procedures to ensure compliance with those requirements and to ensure consistency with the guidelines presented in NCUA Letter to Credit Unions Number 10-FCU-03. 2. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Experience Officer (CXO) are responsible for the oversight and management of the program. 3. Credit Union Management is instructed to oversee programs for the sales of non-deposit investment products, including features of the sales programs, the roles of involved employees, and the roles of third party entities. 4. Management must provide sufficient oversight to address the following: 5. Supervision of personnel involved in non-deposit investment sales programs. Credit Union management will ensure that specific individuals employed by the Credit Union, an affiliated broker/dealer, or a third party vendor are responsible for each activity outlined in the Credit Union\u2019s sales policy. The roles of the entities selling on credit union premises, including supervision of salespeople. Credit Union management will monitor compliance by other entities on an on-going basis. At a minimum, the Credit Union will (a) ensure that all salespeople and staff involved in sales programs are appropriately trained, qualified and licensed, (b) respond promptly to member complaints or inquiries with respect to any sales program, and (c) obtain and review records and reports of sales activities. The types of products that the Credit Union will sell. For each type of product sold by Credit Union employees, the Credit Union will identify specific laws, regulations, regulatory conditions and any other limitations or requirements, including qualitative considerations that will expressly govern the selection and marketing of products the credit union will offer. Permissible uses of Credit Union member information. Management will restrict and control the use of Credit Union member information for any purpose in connection with credit union-related non-deposit investment sales or services to comply with the Credit Union\u2019s privacy policy and applicable laws and regulations on sharing of non-public member information with affiliates and non-affiliates. Establishing and setting sales protocols of Non-Deposit Investment Products.The marketing of non-deposit investment products must take place in a manner that does not mislead or confuse members as to the nature or risks of these uninsured products. To avoid member confusion about these products, the marketing of non-deposit products must be specifically restricted to locations separated from deposit-taking activities (teller windows and member service areas). Marketing areas, such as a designated office, reception area, or cubicle, will be clearly and conspicuously identified as venues for non-deposit sales functions. To avoid the possibility of member confusion, the Credit Union will not offer uninsured investment products with a product name identical to the Credit Union\u2019s name. Recognizing that the potential for member confusion may be increased when the Credit Union uses uninsured product names similar to the Credit Union\u2019s own, sales training will be designed to minimize this risk. Disclosures and Advertising. Complete and accurate disclosure must be provided to avoid member confusion as to whether a credit union-related product is an uninsured investment product or an insured deposit. When selling, advertising or marketing uninsured investment products to members, the following product disclosures will be made: Non-deposit investment products (NDIP) are not federally insured; NDIP are not obligations of the Credit Union; NDIP are not guaranteed by the Credit Union or any affiliated entity; DIP involve investment risks, including the possible loss of principal; and, NDIP could be offered by an employee who can accept members\u2019 deposits and sell NDIP. 6. These disclosures, in written form, should be in a location and type size that are clear and conspicuous to the member. 7. The Credit Union will obtain a signed statement from members acknowledging such disclosures at the time a non-deposit investment account is opened. For existing accounts established prior to the establishment of this policy, the Credit Union will obtain such a signed statement prior to the next sale on that member\u2019s account. These disclosures will also be featured conspicuously in all written or oral sales presentations, advertising and promotional materials, prospectuses, and periodic statements that include information on both NCUA insured deposit and uninsured non-deposit products. 8. The Credit Union will review credit union-related sales advertisements to ensure that they are accurate, do not mislead members about the nature of the product, and include required disclosures. 9. GUIDELINES AND LIMITS Management will establish appropriate guidelines and limits aligned with regulatory requirements to achieve line of business strategy, goals, and objectives. The initiatives will support member service with investment product offerings and options that generate additive noninterest income contribution to the Credit Union. 10. MONITORING POLICY COMPLIANCE The Credit Union will maintain a compliance program to verify compliance with this policy and with any other applicable requirements. The compliance function will be performed independently of investment product sales and management. The following procedures will be required minimum components of the Credit Union\u2019s compliance program: Review of sample non-deposit accounts for: Appropriate signatures, account agreements, disclosures, and other account documents; Evidence of appropriate due diligence, including documentation of members\u2019 investment expectations and goals, tolerance for risk, time horizons, income, etc.; Account activity and purchases commensurate with members\u2019 risk profile and investment goals; and Evidence that salespeople refrain from abusive or deceptive practices such as \u201cchurning\u201d or steering members to inappropriate investments. Testing of sales and account records, including verification procedures with members, to provide reasonable assessment of internal controls. Review of any member complaints. Evaluation of sales staff training, qualifications, and licensing (as applicable). No Credit Union employee, other than a dual employee acting in the capacity of a representative of a CUSO or other third party, shall offer investment advice. However, Credit Union personnel should have thorough product knowledge and understand member protection requirements, and are permitted to direct members with inquiries to the appropriate representative. Other Federal and State Regulations The Credit Union will comply with the anti-fraud provisions of applicable federal and state laws that prohibit materially misleading or inaccurate representations in connection with offers and sales of securities. If members are misled about the nature of non-deposit investment products, including their uninsured status, the Credit Union could face potential liability under these antifraud provisions. Safe and sound operating practices also require that sales programs be operated to avoid member confusion about the products being offered. Use of non-Credit Union employees to sell these products does not relieve Credit Union management of the responsibility to take reasonable steps to ensure that the investment sales program meets these requirements. The Credit Union will adopt the Rules of Fair Practice of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority as a \u201cbest practices\u201d model for its compliance program for safe and sound sales of non-deposit investment products. 11. POLICY EXCEPTION Any exception to this policy statement shall first be approved by the CEO with disclosure to the BOD at its next regularly scheduled meeting. Any corrective actions to bring the noted exception into compliance with policy shall be discussed and documented in applicable BOD meeting minutes.

RESPONSIBILITY This policy will be reviewed by the Board annually. The Chief Operating Officer is responsible for monitoring the general regulatory environment and for bringing to the attention of the Chief Executive Officer matters that should be considered by the Board of Directors and addressed by revision of this Policy, as appropriate. 1. Types of Participation Loans The Credit Union will only purchase or sell Participation Loans that are described by this Policy. Such purchases or sales of Participation Loans are limited to the types of loans that the Credit Union is empowered to make, as further described in its Consumer Loan and Commercial Loan Policies. In accordance with those policies, the Credit Union may purchase or sell the following types of loans in accordance with a written agreement(s) that has (have) been approved by the Board of Directors; provided that they are individual loans and not bundled loans. Secured/Unsecured Term Loans Secured/Unsecured Lines of Credit Commercial Real Estate Loans, including Construction and Development loans 1. Market Area for Participation Loans The Credit Union's Primary Market for member business lending is defined as the geography that is consistent with the Credit Union's charter and includes any company that is already an affiliate or select employee group of the Credit Union. Since the Credit Union may purchase Participation Loans from any Eligible Institution, and the Credit Union's market for Participation Loans could potentially be anywhere within the United States, the Credit Union has determined that it will primarily buy loan participations from other eligible organizations located within the State of New York, but will also consider opportunities in other states on a case by case basis. 1. Although the credit union will consider all opportunities on a case by case basis, based on AmeriCU participation delinquencies and associated issues, it will further scrutinize participation loans from the states of Florida, California, Illinois and Texas or any market that is unfamiliar and or significantly distant from the credit union's core market. 2. Investment Limits 1. Limitation on Single Borrower Aggregate Amount The Credit Union will not purchase any Participation Loan, if after giving effect to such purchase, its aggregate exposure (including any unfunded commitments) to any one borrower, or group of associated borrowers, exceeds 15% of the Credit Union's Net Worth, or if the Single Borrower Aggregate Loan Exposure (including any unfunded commitments) that is owed to the Credit Union by any member or group of associated members exceeds 10% of the outstanding commercial loan portfolio at the end of any calendar month, or $15 million, whichever is greater but cannot exceed the regulatory limit of 15% of net worth. 2. Limitations on Aggregate Amount to any one Originator The Credit Union establishes a limit on the aggregate amount of loan participations that may be purchased from any one originating lender, not to exceed 100% of Net Worth. 3. Additionally, the credit union has established limits on the amount of loan participations that may be purchased by each real estate loan type based on a percentage of the credit union's net worth, in total not to exceed 100%. The limits are as follows: Residential (Multi) | 20.00% ---|--- Mixed Use | 10.00% Industrial | 10.00% Office | 10.00% Retail | 5.00% Hospitality | 10.00% Storage | 5.00% Mobile Home Park | 10.00% Medical | 10.00% Warehouse | 10.00% 1. Interest Rates and Maturities 1. Interest Rates Interest rates on commercial loans will be determined by competitive market conditions and through the underwriting process. The Chief Operating Officer and/or Chief Financial Officer has direct responsibility for establishing the indices and pricing strategies that will be used to price member business loans and with the concurrence of the Finance, responsibility for determining the ranges for the Risk Margin that will apply to each particular type of business loan. The Credit Union's underwriting process includes the assignment of a Risk Grade to every business loan and credit relationship. The Risk Grade is the primary determinant for establishing the required Risk Margin for each member business loan in accordance with the Credit Union's Commercial Underwriting Procedures Manual. 2. Underwriting Participation Loans The Credit Union will focus on the purchase of individual Participation Loans where the risks of repayment have been clearly identified and where the primary and secondary sources of repayment are both realistic and substantive. Generally, the underwriting process for Participation Loans uses recognized methods of financial analysis to determine whether or not the primary source of repayment, the borrower's cash flow, is sufficient to repay the loan within its original terms and conditions. 1. Underwriting Standards In accordance with NCUA Regulations, Part 701.22(b)(i) the Credit Union must establish underwriting guidelines. The Credit Union will use the same underwriting standards for participation loans that it uses for commercial loans that are not being sold in a participation agreement. Moreover, the Credit Union will practice the same due diligence in evaluating the purchase of any Participation Loan that it applies to the underwriting of any loan, regardless of type, that it might originate on behalf of one of its own members. 2. Loan Approval Authority By adopting this Participation Loan Policy for Commercial Lending, the Board of Directors has charged the individuals designated below with the responsibility of reviewing and approving all member business loan requests. The level of loan approval authority granted is based upon the individual's experience, qualifications and training with respect to business lending. Commercial loan approval authority is required to approve any loan administered by the Commercial Lending Department. If the Loan Committee is designated as the loan approval authority based on the amount of the loan, then all individuals listed as part of the Committee must sign the loan approval. 3. | Unsecured | Secured ---|---|--- VP, Business Services | $500,000 | $5,000,000 Chief Lending Officer or EVP, Chief Operating Officer or Chief Executive Officer | $500,000 | $10,000,000 Loan Committee \u2013 VP, Business Services, EVP, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Lending Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Chief Executive Officer | $500,000 | Over $10,000,000 4. Outsourcing of Participation Loan Underwriting At present, the Credit Union does employ individuals with sufficient background in commercial lending to meet the experience requirement outlined in NCUA Regulations Part 723.6(f); individuals with at least two years of commercial lending experience. However, if the Credit Union determines that it does not have the necessary expertise, or that it will be more cost effective to outsource of a particular Participation Loan, it may retain the services of an independent consultant or a credit union service organization (CUSO) to provide such services. This determination may apply to the Credit Union's ongoing requirements with regard to Participation Loans or may be limited to a specific transaction, as necessary. 3. Other Restrictions 1. As the Originating Lender Whenever the Credit Union is the Originating Lender of a Participation Loan, the Credit Union shall: Originate loans only to its members; Originate loans to eligible organizations (see definitions); Retain an interest of at least 10% of the face amount of each loan; Retain the original or copies of all loan documents, and As noted above, require that the appropriate credit approval authority use the same underwriting standards that are normally used for loans that are not being sold in a Participation Agreement. Provide the same degree of due diligence in monitoring and servicing the loan that is applied to any loan that is held in the Portfolio, including an annual review of the borrowers financial condition and ongoing financial performance. 2. As the Participating Lender Whenever the Credit Union is the Participating Lender of a Participation Loan, the Credit Union shall: Participate only in loans that it is empowered to make; Purchase participation loans from eligible organizations (see definitions); Retain the original or a copy of the written participation agreement and a schedule of the loans covered by the agreement, and; Provide the same degree of due diligence in monitoring and servicing the loan that is applied to any loan that is held in the Portfolio, including an annual review of the borrowers financial condition and ongoing financial performance.

An explanation of the duties and responsibilities of the originating lender, servicer and participants with respect to all aspects of the participation, including servicing, default, foreclosure, collection and other matters involving the ongoing administration of the loans. Circumstances and conditions under which participants may replace the servicer. 4. Waivers For borrower or loan level waivers, if the originating lender obtains a waiver for a loan, the participating credit unions DO NOT also have to obtain waivers for their participation interests in that loan. The Credit Union must obtain the NCUA waiver as well as NY state regulatory approval. If the originating lender DOES NOT obtain a waiver for a loan, each participant is required to obtain its own waiver for its interest in the participated loan. Participant waivers do not pass to other participants, only the originating lender's does. The Credit Union MUST obtain a copy of any waiver approvals from the originating lender prior to purchasing the subject loan participations. 1. Borrower or loan level waivers may be granted for: Appraisal requirements 2. Credit Union level waivers (the participating credit union must obtain its own waiver) may be granted for: Single originating lender concentration limit, Single borrower concentration limit, RESOURCES/REFERENCES ACU-02-006 Asset Liability Management NCUA Rules and Regulations, Part 701.22, Section 454(35) & Section 2(11) of the New York Banking Law ACU-03-008 Commercial Loan Policy Consumer Loan Policy PREVIOUSLY KBID 1833 ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTORS N/A", "policystat_url_direct": "https://americu.policystat.com/policy/17692021/", "policystat_url_latest": "https://americu.policystat.com/policy/17692021/latest/", "policystat_url_guest_access": "https://americu.policystat.com/?lt=cEdmjq-OJYCVZNejpWpI-e&next=%2Fpolicy%2F17692021%2Flatest%2F", "tags": ["Board Approved", "Compliance Department Review"]}, {"name": "ACU-03-007 Commercial Loan Policy", "id": 17692679, "category_name": "ACU-03 Lending", "author_name": "Arnold, John: VP, Business Services", "applicability_group_name": "AmeriCU Credit Union", "text_preview": "POLICY STATEMENT The policy of AmeriCU Credit Union (the \"Credit Union\") is to provide loans to members and member owned businesses that are secured by appropriate business and personal assets and comply with United States law and all applicable federal and state regulations.

(3) If the borrower is a member or partner of a partnership, joint venture, or association, and the other person with a shared ownership, investment, or other pecuniary interest in a business or commercial endeavor with the borrower is another member or partner of the partnership, joint venture, or association, and neither a direct benefit nor a common enterprise exists, such other person is not an associated borrower. \"Common Enterprise\" means: (1) The expected source of repayment for each loan or extension of credit is the same for each borrower and no individual borrower has another source of income from which the loan (together with the borrower's other obligations) may be fully repaid. An employer will not be treated as a source of repayment because of wages and salaries paid to an employee, unless the standards described in paragraph (2) of this definition are met; (2) Loans or extensions of credit are made: (i) To borrowers who are related directly or indirectly through common control, including where one borrower is directly or indirectly controlled by another borrower; and (ii) Substantial financial interdependence exists between or among the borrowers. Substantial financial interdependence means 50 percent or more of one borrower's gross receipts or gross expenditures (on an annual basis) are derived from transactions with another borrower. Gross receipts and expenditures include gross revenues or expenses, intercompany loans, dividends, capital contributions, and similar receipts or payments; or (3) Separate borrowers obtain loans or extensions of credit to acquire a business enterprise of which those borrowers will own more than 50 percent of the voting securities or voting interests. \"Control\" means a person or entity directly or indirectly, or acting through or together with one or more persons or entities: (1) Owns, controls, or has the power to vote 25 percent or more of any class of voting securities of another person or entity; (2) Controls, in any manner, the election of a majority of the directors, trustees, or other persons exercising similar functions of another person or entity; or (3) Has the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of another person or entity. \"Credit Risk Rating System\" means a formal process that identifies and assigns a relative credit risk score to each commercial loan in a federally insured credit union's portfolio, using ordinal ratings to represent the degree of risk. The credit risk score is determined through an evaluation of quantitative factors based on financial performance and qualitative factors based on management, operational, market, and business environmental factors. \"Direct Benefit\" means the proceeds of a loan or extension of credit to a borrower, or assets purchased with those proceeds, that are transferred to another person or entity, other than in a bona fide arm's-length transaction where the proceeds are used to acquire property, goods, or services. \"Immediate Family Member\" is defined as a spouse or other family member living in the same household. \"Loan Secured by a 1- to 4-Family Residential Property _ \"_ means a loan that, at origination, is secured wholly or substantially by a lien on a 1- to 4-family residential property for which the lien is central to the extension of the credit; that is, the borrower would not have been extended credit in the same amount or on terms as favorable without the lien. A loan is wholly or substantially secured by a lien on a 1-to 4-family residential property if the estimated value of the real estate collateral at origination (after deducting any senior liens held by others) is greater than 50 percent of the principal amount of the loan. \"Loan Secured by a Vehicle Manufactured for Household use\" means a loan that, at origination, is secured wholly or substantially by a lien on a new and used passenger car and other vehicle such as a minivan, sport-utility vehicle, pickup truck, and similar light truck or heavy-duty truck generally manufactured for personal, family, or household use and not used as a fleet vehicle or to carry fare-paying passengers, for which the lien is central to the extension of credit. A lien is central to the extension of credit if the borrower would not have been extended credit in the same amount or on terms as favorable without the lien. A loan is wholly or substantially secured by a lien on a vehicle manufactured for household use if the estimated value of the collateral at origination (after deducting any senior liens held by others) is greater than 50 percent of the principal amount of the loan. \"Loan-to-Value Ratio\" means, with respect to any item of collateral, the aggregate amount of all sums borrowed and secured by that collateral, including outstanding balances plus any unfunded commitment or line of credit from another lender that is senior to the federally insured credit union's lien position, divided by the current collateral value. The current collateral value must be established by prudent and accepted commercial lending practices and comply with all regulatory requirements. For a construction and development loan, the collateral value is the lesser of cost to complete or prospective market value, as determined in accordance with \u00a7 723.6. \"Market Value\" means the most probable price which a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to an independent \"arms length\" transaction between an equally motivated buyer and seller. The Market Value, with respect to a Construction and Development Loan is defined as the appraised value of the land on which the project is to be built, less any liens, plus the cost to construct the project. \"Total Commercial Loan Balance\" means the outstanding loan balance plus any unfunded commitments, reduced by any portion of the loan that is secured by shares in the Credit Union, or by shares or deposits in other financial institutions or insured or guaranteed by any agency of the federal government, a state or any political subdivision of such state, subject to an advance commitment to purchase, or sold as a participation interest without recourse. \"Net Worth\" means the retained earnings balance of the credit union at quarter end as determined under generally accepted accounting principles. Retained earnings consist of undivided earnings, regular reserves, and any other appropriations designated by management or regulatory authorities. \"Principal\" with regard to the personal guaranty requirement described in Part 723.7, means one or more natural persons having a majority ownership interest in, or otherwise exercise management control over the business organization receiving the loan.

RESPONSIBILITIES This Policy will be reviewed by the Board, annually. The Chief Operating Officer is responsible for monitoring the general regulatory environment and informing the Chief Executive Officer of matters that should, in turn, be brought to the attention of the Board of Directors, to be addressed by revision of this Policy. 1. Types of Commercial Loans 1. The type of loan or combination of loans, provided to any member's business will be determined through the credit underwriting process. The primary objective of that process is to protect the Credit Union from undue risk of loss through the application of safe and sound lending practices. An important secondary objective is to provide the borrowing capacity deemed necessary for the successful operation of the member's business. The Credit Union's Single Borrower Aggregate Limit to any business borrower or group of associated business borrowers (including any unfunded commitments) is outlined in detail below. Any insured or guaranteed portion of a commercial loan made through a program in which a federal and state agency (or its political subdivision) ensures repayment, guarantees or provides an advance commitment to purchase the loan in full, is excluded from this limit. 2. Certain situations may arise where seemingly unrelated entities should be considered to be a \"group of associated borrowers\". The following conditions would warrant an aggregation of exposure regardless of the percentage of ownership: 1. The business relationships between the entities are such that one entity effectively exercises management control over the other. 2. The entities are related as result of guarantees, throughput agreements, production payments or repurchase agreements. 3. The entities share common ownership, and taken as a whole are engaged in a \"common business enterprise\", even if no single member holds a majority interest. 3. The Credit Union may provide any one or a combination of the following types of loans to a member's business, provided the maximum liability of any member's business shall not at any time exceed the limits set forth below for each type of loan: Loan Type | Aggregate Maximum Loan Amount | Maximum LTV | Maximum Term (months) | Maximum Amortization (months) ---|---|---|---|--- Business Credit Card | Up to $25,000 | N/A | Revolving | N/A Line of Credit (Unsecured) | Up to $500,000 | N/A | Demand | N/A Term Loan (Unsecured) | Up to $500,000 | N/A | Up to 120 | Up to 120 Line of Credit (Secured) | Up to $2,000,000 | Up to 100% | Demand | N/A Term Loan (Secured) | Up to $5,000,000 | Up to 100% | Up to180 | Up to180 Commercial Real Estate | Single Borrower Limit | (1) | Up to 180 | Up to 300 Construction and Development Real Estate | Single Borrower Limit | (1) | Up to 24 | N/A 4. Commercial Real Estate Loan-to-Value limits: i. Land Development | up to 75% ---|--- ii. Specialized Asset | up to 75% iii. Commercial Construction | up to 80% iv. Improved Property | up to 85% v. Specialized Collateral \u2013 will be limited to industry type loan to value ranges and criteria explained in the credit underwriting presentation. 5. Commercial mortgage loans may be secured with either a first, second or third mortgage (provided the Credit Union has the first and second lien positions) on the following types of properties: 1. Commercial properties where the business is the owner and primary tenant of the property. 2. Mixed-use properties where a portion of the property is used for residential use and a portion is for small business use. 3. Residential properties that have been converted to use as professional offices and are zoned accordingly. 4. Commercial or residential properties that are owned by a member or owned by a real estate holding company owned by a member, are held for investment purposes, and are available for rental on a weekly, monthly, annual, seasonal or other interim basis. 6. Owner Occupied Commercial Real Estate Loans 1. An Owner Occupied Commercial Real Estate Loan is defined as a loan, secured by real estate, where (1) the owner's business occupies at least 51% of the premises, and (2) there is a demonstrated ability to service all debt from internally generated cash flow of the owner's business, exclusive of any third party rental income. The basic underwriting procedures for an owner occupied commercial mortgage loan are identical to those outlined for commercial loans in the Credit Union's Commercial Loan Procedures. 2. It is the Credit Union's policy that owner occupied commercial mortgage loans are not considered as \"stand alone\" loan products (i.e., need to be co-borroweers/guarantors for primary source of repayment purposes). It is expected this type of exposure will be used as a relationship tool and should be applied to attract or retain the business of a particularly attractive customer. The creditworthiness of the borrower, and relationship with the client, are critical elements in considering this type of exposure, due to the long-term maturity and amortization schedule of such loans. 7. Non-Owner Occupied Commercial Real Estate Loans 1. A Non-Owner Occupied Commercial Real Estate Loan is defined as a loan, secured by real estate, where (1) the premises is not occupied at all by the owner, or is occupied less than 51% by the owner, and (2) there is a demonstrated ability to service all debt by taking into consideration the cash flow of the property, as derived from third party rental income, as well as the owner's business income. 8. Non-Owner Occupied Investment Property Loans 1. A Non-Owner Occupied Investment Property Loan is defined as a loan that is secured by a residential rental property that has been purchased by the borrower for investment purposes. 9. Construction and Development Loans 1. These loan types can be either Owner or Non-Owner Occupied real estate. A commercial real estate construction loan is secured by a first mortgage on a commercial property. 2. Additional risk mitigation steps must be completed for construction and development loans. At a minimum, these additional standards must include (see procedures for more information and risk mitigation for these types of loans): Loan to value calculations will use a collateral valuation which represents the lesser of the cost to complete or the \u201cas complete\u201d appraised value. Draw schedules must be developed and implemented. All advances of funds require an independent valuation of the work completed in accordance with the draw schedule. Review for intervening liens must be completed before the release of any advances. 10. Cannabis Loans 1. The credit union will entertain loan requests from cannabis and cannabis-related businesses. Please refer to the attached Specialty Commercial Lending Addendum. 2. Primary Market 1. The Credit Union's Primary Market for commercial lending is defined as the geography that is consistent with the Credit Union's charter and includes any company that is already an affiliate, business partner or select employee group of the Credit Union. The Credit Union will consider applications for commercial loans from any business located within this geography or already within its field of membership, provided the business loan is not deemed prohibited. See the Underwriting Procedures Manual for additional detail on business eligibility and collateral location. 3. Commercial Loan Investment Limits 1. Limitation on the Total Commercial Loan Portfolio 1. A Credit Union is permitted to maintain a Commercial Loan portfolio that is limited to the lesser of 1.75 times the actual net worth of the Credit Union, or 1.75 times the minimum net worth required under section 1790d(c)(1)(A of the Federal Credit Union Act. The Credit Union is deemed a \"low income\" designated Credit Union. 2. Limitation on Single Borrower Aggregate Amount 1. The Credit Union will not make any commercial loan if, after giving effect to the making of such loan, the Single Borrower Aggregate Loan exposure owed by any one business member or group of associated business members exceeds the regulatory limit of 15% of net worth. 3. Limitation on each Type of Commercial Loan The Credit Union will limit its total investment (including any unfunded commitments) in each type of commercial loan. In addition, the Credit Union will limit its aggregate Unsecured Commercial Loan exposure (including any unfunded commitments) to any one member or group of associated members up to $500,000. 1. All Commercial Real Estate Mortgages 1. 175% of Net Worth 2. Additionally, Further specific sub concentration limits for real estate loans are limited as follows: 1. Residential (1-4) 20.00% 2. Residential (Multi) 32.00% 3. Mixed Use 13.00% 4. Industrial 8.00% 5. Office 3.00% 6. Retail 10.00% 7. Hospitality 4.00% 8. Storage 2.00% 9. Mobile Home Park 2.00% 10. Medical 4.00% 11. Warehouse 2.00% 2. All Construction and Development Loans 1. 20% of Net Worth 3. All Secured Term and Lines of Credit Loans (non-CRE) 50% of Net Worth 4. All Unsecured Term and Lines of Credit Loans (including credit cards and overdraft LOC) 25% of Net Worth 5. Non-recourse Loans 15% of Net Worth 4. Portfolio Monitoring 1. The Investment Limits outlined in this Section of the Policy will be monitored through the maintenance of a Concentration Report, which will be reviewed by the Chief Operating Officer and reported to the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. 4. Interest Rates and Maturities 1. Interest Rates 1. Interest rates on commercial loans will be determined by competitive market conditions and through the underwriting process. The Chief Financial Officer or Chief Operating Officer has direct responsibility for establishing the indices and pricing strategies that will be used to price commercial loans with the concurrence of Finance. The Credit Union's underwriting process includes the assignment of a Risk Grade to every commercial loan and credit relationship. The Risk Grade is the primary determinant for establishing the required Risk Margin for each commercial loan. 2. Maturities 1. Generally, commercial loans will have maturities consistent with the financing purpose for which the loan is made, or the estimated useful life of the asset being financed. The final maturity will be determined during the underwriting process and will not exceed the depreciable life of the asset being financed. Regardless of the collateral, the Credit Union will not make a commercial loan with a final maturity in excess of 15 years from the origination date and up to an amortization of 25 years. Lines of Credit by regulatory definition have no stated maturity date (interest only) but will be monitored annually. 5. Underwriting Commercial Loans 1. The Credit Union will focus on lending to fundamentally sound businesses or individuals where the risks of repayment have been clearly identified and where the primary and secondary sources of repayment are both realistic and substantive. Generally, the underwriting process uses recognized methods of financial analysis to determine whether or not the primary source of repayment is sufficient to repay the loan within its original terms and conditions. 2. Loan Underwriting Qualifications 1. At present, the Credit Union meets the required expertise and experience criteria, as follows: _Senior executive officers_ overseeing the commercial lending function understand the Credit Union's commercial lending activities. Senior executive officers have a comprehensive understanding of the role of commercial lending in the Credit Union's overall business model and establish risk management processes and controls necessary to safely conduct commercial lending. _Qualified lending personnel_ are qualified with experience in the following areas: Underwriting and processing for the type(s) of commercial lending in which the Credit Union is engaged; overseeing and evaluating the performance of a commercial loan portfolio, including rating and quantifying risk through a credit risk rating system and risk rating worksheets; and, conducting collection and loss mitigation activities for the type(s) of commercial lending in which the Credit Union engages. 3. Financial Analysis, Cash Flow Analysis and Industry Comparisons 1. The Credit Union\u2019s underwriting process includes a documented analysis of the business, its historic performance, competitive environment, available resources and prospects for the future. Specific underwriting procedures include but are not limited to an evaluation of the financial statements and tax returns of the business and the personal financial statement and tax returns of each guarantor, and a review of the character and reputation of each borrower and guarantor. The Credit Union will employ standard financial analytical techniques in the underwriting process, in order to determine the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan, which will be accomplished by the measurement of specific financial ratios outlined in the Underwriting Procedures Manual. Most importantly, the Credit Union will not approve new/renewals/refinances for commercial loans if the demonstrated cash flow of the borrower results in a Debt Service Coverage Ratio of less than 1.20x and/or, if applicable, positive Cash After Debt Amortization for businesses with heavy balance sheets (operating entities). 2. In those cases where industry comparisons are available, the financial information for each commercial loan applicant will be compared to similar sized companies operating in similar lines of business. Typically, the comparative information will be obtained from IBISWorld US, or a similar reporting agency. Whenever such information is available, particular attention will be given to liquidity, leverage and cash flow, as measured by specific balance sheet and income statement ratios. It is expected comparable information may not always be obtainable for every loan. 4. Periodic Review Requirement 1. Every commercial loan relationship with aggregate exposure of $500,000 or less will not be reviewed on a periodic basis. These loans will be reviewed, if issues are revealed. All loans are monitored for delinquency, monthly. 2. Every commercial loan relationship with aggregate exposure of $500,000 and up to $750,000 will require a non-financial limited periodic review. The review will confirm local market conditions, evaluate guarantors\u2019 credit, note appraisal values (an exterior commercial inspection will be ordered based on need) and update the risk rating worksheet. If the risk rating is Special Mention or worse, a full loan review will be required. 3. Every commercial loan greater than $750,000 and up to $2,500,000 will require a limited periodic review. The review will include limited financial analysis with confirmation of local market conditions and appraisal values will be noted (an exterior commercial inspection will be ordered based on need) and the risk rating worksheet will be updated. If the risk rating is Special Mention or worse, a full loan review is required. 4. Every commercial loan relationship with aggregate exposure greater than $2,500,000 will be reviewed on a periodic basis (not to exceed an 18-month cycle) in accordance with the same underwriting procedures that were applied when the loan was originated. That review includes a full underwriting of the loan and/or loan relationship. 5. Personal Guarantee Requirement 1. In general, regardless of the manner in which the business is organized (S-Corp., C-Corp., Partnership, Limited Partnership or Limited Liability Company) every commercial loan will typically require the full and unconditional personal guarantee of all principals and/or corporations of the borrowing entity. Principals are defined as one or more natural persons who have a majority ownership interest (20% or more) in the business organization receiving the loan. If the entity is the owner of the real estate, all owners must be party to the security agreement but do not have to be on the loan if ownership is less than 20%. At anytime and in any situation the Manager, Commercial Credit Risk can require an owner with less than 20% ownership to personally guarantee the loan as in situations with related entity owners and owners that manage the day-to-day operations of the business. Not for profit organizations, as defined by the Internal Revenue Service Code (26 U.S.C 501) do not require a guarantee and are considered non-recourse loans. 2. On a case-by-case basis, the CU can approve loans without personal guarantees, or with limited personal guarantees, with the authorization of the EVP, Chief Operating Officer or Chief Lending Officer and with good mitigating criteria outlined in the approval. At a minimum, loans made without or with limited guarantors should have the following criteria: loan must be risk rated 3 Good (Modest Risk) or better; two years of satisfactory financial performance (unless the loan is for an arms-length purchase); positive current and past trend in business equity (unless the loan is for an arms-length purchase, then this will be a financial covenant, if appropriate); loan-to-value no more than 75%; exceptional liquidity to support the loan; and a global understanding of the operations and financial strength of the principals. The Credit Union will limit the amount of non-recourse loans made to businesses according to policy, and up to the Single Borrower Aggregate Limit per obligor without recourse. 6. Small Business Administration Loan Guarantee Programs 1. As part of the commercial loan program the Credit Union expects to make use of SBA Loan Guarantee Programs, whenever a specific transaction might benefit from such treatment or the borrower's industry is higher risk (hotels, restaurants, entertainment, etc), the Credit Union intends to underwrite and fund these transactions whenever an SBA Guarantee might be advantageous to the member's business. In all cases where the Credit Union underwrites a loan in anticipation of seeking an SBA guarantee, it will do so in accordance with the Small Business Administration's Loan Policy SOP 50 10 5. In accordance with NCUA Regulations Part 723.4(b), the Credit Union may make a loan as part of an SBA guaranteed loan program with loan requirements that are less restrictive than those required by the NCUA, including the collateral and security requirements of Part 723.3 and Part 723.7. 2. Please note: because the SBA will not guarantee a loan issued to a business including non-US citizens, a proposed loan to such a business that would require an SBA guarantee may be denied for this reason. 6. Loan to Value Ratio and Collateral Valuation 1. Liens and Lien Search 1. Prior to the making of any secured commercial loan, a lien search will be conducted in the appropriate jurisdictions to ensure the collateral being pledged is free and clear of any other encumbrances. The Credit Union will secure its position by filing liens (UCC-1) on the borrower's business assets and such other personal assets as may be offered by the guarantor(s); or by filing a lien on title documents, in the case of titled vehicles. Subsequent to the filing of any lien, periodic monitoring will occur to ensure the Credit Union's lien has attached and is continuing. 2. Title Search and Mortgagee/Loss Payee Insurance 1. Regardless of the level of appraisal conducted, a complete title search is required. Subsequently, a title search/title policy commitment, verifying the appropriate lien position that was anticipated when the loan was underwritten, will be obtained prior to the closing of loans secured by real estate. The Credit Union must be named as mortgagee and/or loss payee on any insurance coverage, including flood insurance (where required), with regard to any collateral securing any loan. Appropriate insurance certification which confirms the Credit Union's position as mortgagee and/or loss payee is required, prior to the closing of any loan secured by such collateral. 3. Collateral Valuation 1. Collateral valuation will be accomplished by various methods, commensurate with the size of the transaction, the Credit Union's total exposure, and the nature of the collateral. Assets other than real estate assets will be valued in accordance with normal business practices using recognized equipment appraisers or competent field auditors to determine asset values for loans, if applicable. 4. Loan to Value \u2013 Advance Rates 1. Collateral being offered for any transaction will be valued using the methods and maximum loan to value ratios indicated in the following table: Loan Type | Collateral Type | Valuation Method | Advance Rates or LTV ---|---|---|--- Secured Line of Credit (Working Capital) | Accounts Receivable (Current) | Financial Statement or Accounts Receivable Aging Report | Not more than 75% of receivables 90 days and less. Secured Line of Credit (Working Capital) | Inventory (No Work in Process, WIP) | Financial Statement or Inventory List | Not more than 50% of finished goods inventory and raw materials Secured Line of Credit | Real Estate | Appraisal or Evaluation | Not more than 85% Secured Line of Credit or Term Loan | Machinery, Vehicles and Equipment | Cost or Appraisal | Up to 100% on new; Up to 80% on Used. Term Loan | Express Direct New and Used Vehicle | New \u2013 Invoice and Used NADA Retail | Up to 110% (including licensing fees and taxes) Commercial Mortgage | Non-Owner/Owner Occupied Investment Properties | Appraisal or Evaluation | Not more than 85% Construction and Development | Non-Owner/Owner Occupied Investment Properties | Construction Costs or \"As Completed\" Appraisal | Not more than 80% 2. Will only be considered on a case by case basis and in conjunction with another real estate loan by the same borrower. Additionally, the owner of the real estate must also be the borrower on the loan. 3. Loans secured by an AmeriCU Account can have an LTV up to 100% of the Deposit Account/50% -75% for Marketable Securities. 5. Appraisals 1. In accordance with Part 722.3, an appraisal is required for all new, refinanced or restructured real estate and secured loan transactions in amounts greater than or equal to $1,000,000, as outlined below. All appraisals will be performed by an Appraiser who is Certified or Licensed by the State in which the property is located, and who is experienced in providing an opinion of value for the type of property being financed. An appraisal is also required whenever the property securing a loan is heading towards foreclosure and should be ordered as soon as the loan is identified as a problem loan. 2. All appraisals will be ordered independently by one of the designated Commercial Loan Administrators or Credit Analysts in the Business Services Department. The Appraisal must be completed by an appraiser who (a) is identified on the Credit Union's separately approved roster of Approved Commercial Appraisers, (b) has no direct or indirect interest in the property, (c) is qualified and experienced to perform such estimates of value for the type and amount of credit being considered, and (d) is either Certified or Licensed by the State in which the property is located. A review of each appraisal and concurrence to the value must be completed by the Credit Union's selected and qualified vendor. In cases where the appraised value is in question, a second approved appraiser may be engaged at the discretion of the Business Services Department to review the initial appraiser's results. 3. Appraisals ordered by the Credit Union are considered to be confidential information for internal review purposes and are not to be released to any third party. The only exception to this policy would be an instance where such release is in conjunction with other services to be performed by the third party on behalf of the Credit Union. In those cases, written acknowledgement from the recipient, regarding the confidential nature of the information is required. The Business Member/Property owner is entitled to a copy of the appraisal. 4. In accordance with part 722.5 (b) (2), any appraisal previously ordered by another financial institution, may be accepted by the Credit Union if (i) the appraiser has no direct or indirect interest, financial or otherwise, in the property or transaction, (ii) the Credit Union determines the appraisal conforms to the requirements of Part 722.4 and is verified as compliant and value is supported by a qualified third party; (iii) the Manager, Commercial Credit Risk concurs with the acceptability of the appraisal, and (iv) the appraisal has been assigned to the Credit Union by the appraiser. The appraisal reports referred to herein as an \"Appraisal Report\" and \"Restricted Appraisal Report\" are as defined in accordance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, as published by the Appraisal Institute. 5. The Commercial Operations Manager or the Credit Analyst of the Business Services Department will determine the type of appraisal, based on the nature of the property and the Credit Union's aggregate exposure, and the estimated value of the property securing each loan. The following guidelines will generally apply, regardless of whether the property is owner occupied or non-owner occupied: 1. A Restricted Appraisal Report or a Commercial Evaluation is required for the following transactions and can be performed by either a Certified/Licensed New York State Appraiser or a qualified 3rd party vendor in the case of a Commercial Evaluation: Transactions of less than $1 million Where a loan is being renewed or refinanced with no advancement of new monies (other than funds to cover reasonable closing costs); provided all the following requirements are met: The borrower has performed satisfactorily in accordance with the original terms There is no obvious or material change in market conditions or physical aspects of the property that would threaten the collateral protection provided by the property, or There has been no deterioration of the borrower's creditworthiness The amount is less than $1 million Where a loan is being renewed or refinanced _with_ new money being advanced, but the new loan amount is less than $1 million. 2. A Narrative Appraisal Report is required for real estate and business transactions where the loan amount is equal to or greater than $1 million, as deemed appropriate by the Commercial Operations Manager or Credit Analyst of the Business Services Department. The appraiser must be a Certified New York State Appraiser. All narrative appraisals must be appropriately reviewed and accepted prior to any loan closing. 6. In order to accept an appraisal, the appraiser must be on the Credit Union's roster of Approved Appraisers, and be capable of rendering an opinion of value on commercial properties that are similar in size and complexity to the property being appraised. In order to become an approved appraiser, the appraiser will be required to provide: At least three references from other financial institutions in the area An example of his or her work. A copy of their license and certification. 7. The Commercial Operations Manager will review the information and, if deemed acceptable, will approve the appraiser. The appraiser will then be added to the Approved Appraiser list. 6. Environmental Reports 1. If any commercial loan is secured, in whole or in part, by a mortgage on a commercial property occupied by a member's business, then appropriate steps must be taken to ensure the property is not subject to any environmental hazards. A completed Environmental Questionnaire is required on all loan transactions of equal to or less than $500,000. A borrower who is purchasing residential real estate can submit an environmental disclosure that is part of the purchase contract in lieu of the Environmental Questionnaire. For loans greater than $500,000 but less than $1 million, an EAQ Loan Check (or similar report from an approved, qualified vendor) environmental assessment is required. For loans of $1 million but less than $2.5 million, a Transaction Screen environmental assessment is required. For loans of $2.5 million or greater, a Phase I environmental assessment is required. 2. At any loan amount, the Manager, Commercial Credit Risk is authorized to require a higher or lower level environmental assessment report. An example of a lower level environmental assessment report ordered would include a blanket lien on several parcels of unrelated property that are separately valued. Environmental reports may be obtained from any local environmental engineering firm on the Credit Union's approved list that has competency in this area; however, the selected firm must be able to produce reports that comply with ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) standards. If further remediation is required by the environmental engineering firm, either the EVP, Chief Operating Officer or Chief Lending Officer can waive. The waiver should be documented with reasons why the remediation was not required. 7. Flood Certification 1. Prior to closing any approved commercial real estate loan, a flood certification report must be obtained from a qualified source. If the subject property is located in a designated flood plain, the commercial borrower is required to obtain flood insurance on the property and provide evidence of this prior to loan closing. The insurance must be maintained during the life of the loan, and the minimum coverage required will be the lesser of (1) the maximum amount of insurance available under FEMA; (2) the insurable value of the property; or (3) the principal loan amount. 7. Acceptable Loans 1. Acceptable loans have certain characteristics in addition to the financial information that is analyzed as part of the underwriting process. Those characteristics can be important factors in the satisfactory repayment of the loan, regardless of the organizational structure or the size of the business. Loans having these characteristics are classified as \"Acceptable\" and include but are not limited to: 1. Loans to businesses that have a demonstrated history of satisfactory financial performance. 2. Loans to businesses secured by equipment, vehicle, inventory, receivables and other assets, which are free and clear of other encumbrances and which otherwise, conform to loan policy. 3. Loans secured by a first lien on the commercial real estate property occupied by the business and owned by the business or the member owning the business. 4. Loans secured by a first, second or third lien on the commercial real estate property occupied by the business and owned by the business or member owning the business. 5. Loans secured by an assignment of the borrower's accounts at the Credit Union, although these loans are excluded, by regulation, from the definition of commercial loans. 8. Prohibited and Riskier Industry Loans 1. Ineligible borrowers include the following: 1. Any senior management employee directly or indirectly involved in the Credit Union's commercial loan underwriting, servicing and collection process, or their immediate family members; Any person meeting the definition of an associated borrower with respect to any senior management employee directly or indirectly involved in the Credit Union's commercial loan underwriting, servicing and collection process, and any of their immediate family members; and Any compensated director, unless the Board of Directors approves granting the loan and the compensated director is recused from the Board's decision making process. 2. A commercial loan, if any additional income received by the Credit Union or senior management employees is tied to the profit or sale of any business or commercial endeavor benefiting from the proceeds of the loan. 3. Any third party used by the Credit Union must be independent from the commercial loan transaction and may not have a participation interest in a loan or an interest in any collateral securing a loan the third party is responsible for reviewing, or an expectation of receiving compensation of any sort that is contingent on the closing of the loan, with the following exceptions: A third party may provide a service to the Credit Union that is related to the transaction, such as loan servicing; The third party may provide the requisite experience to the Credit Union and purchase a loan or a participation interest in a loan originated by the Credit Union that the third party reviewed; and The Credit Union may use the services of a credit union service organization that otherwise meets the requirements of the 723.3(b)(3) of this part even if the Credit Union has a controlling financial interest in the credit union service organization as determined under GAAP. 4. All principals must be US citizens or have valid non-expired immigration status (e.g., Green Card, work visa, or employment authorization document) and an acceptable SSN or ITIN. Note, non-US citizens must satisfy BSA CIP requirements with an acceptable form of ID. 5. The following are considered riskier industry type loans and mitigating risk factors should be considered when making them: Restaurant/Bars Independent Hotels/Motels Investment Office Space Gas Stations/Convenience Stores 9. Loan Approval Authority 1. Loan Approval Authority \\- refer to ACU-01-004 Approval/Authority Limits Policy 2. Policy Exceptions 1. Any exceptions to this Policy must have the approval of the individual with the appropriate level of authority referenced in ACU-01-004 Approval/Authority Limits Policy. The Policy Exception Report provides information on all exception loans, whether approved as an exception to Policy at the time the loan was made, identified as an exception to Policy at a later date, or classified as an exception to Policy based on subsequent events. The Policy Exception Report will identify each specific loan and the criteria by which it is considered an exception. All policy exceptions are reported to the Board, quarterly. 10. Commercial Loan Committee 1. Prior to final approval, the Commercial Loan Committee will review new commercial loan requests over $2 million, plus any loan request when a borrower has an aggregate of loans with AmeriCU exceeding $7 million. 2. The purpose of this committee is to guide our commercial loan department as to risks, credit, terms and rates that are desirable to the credit union for its short and long-term strategic objectives. Committee members will include the VP, Business Services, Chief Risk Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Lending Officer, Chief Financial Operator, AVP Lending Sales, Commercial Loan Officer and Manager, Commercial Credit Risk. The VP, Business Services will be the Chairperson. Other members such as risk management and/or credit analyst may be invited as needed. 3. The committee will be provided sufficient information to review the purpose of the loan, the overall and general qualifications of the borrower(s), and background of the relationship between the borrower(s) and AmeriCU. Any requested follow-up items can be submitted to committee members electronically in lieu of a formal meeting. The Committee may choose to decline the request if the Committee does not like the risk associated with the borrower, collateral or terms being presented. If acceptance is granted by the committee, the loan request will pass through the stages of approval based on authority, as indicated above. 11. Cash Management 1. The Business Services Department assists in the setup and maintenance of cash management services, including ACH. To monitor risks associated with ACH, the Credit Union has developed comprehensive risk analysis procedures regarding new and on-going Originator relationships. 2. Please refer to the ACH Policy for additional details. 12. Reporting 1. The Business Services Department prepares many different types of commercial loan reports at various times. The following reports will be sent to the Board at the end of each quarter: Policy Exception Report \\- This report shows all the active policy exceptions the Credit Union has made for commercial loans. Policy exceptions include ones that were made at origination and ones that were identified during the annual loan review; Concentration Limits Report -This report shows all the policy concentration limits and their relation to net worth. The report shows whether or not the Credit Union is in compliance with all the concentration limits; Ten Largest Commercial Loan Relationships Report \\- This report shows the Credit Union's ten largest commercial loan relationships including the total relationship loan amount, next payment date and origination date; Loan Type Percentages Report \\- This report shows a comparison of our commercial loan portfolio one year apart per loan type; Risk Rating Report \\- This report shows total risk ratings per category compared to the commercial loan portfolio, total assets and total net worth. The report shows the migration of the change in risk ratings one year ago. Loan to Value Report -This report shows the loan to value ratio for commercial real estate loans over $1 million and over 85%. All Nonrecourse Loans Report \u2013 includes all not-for-profit loans; for profit loans without recourse; and, all loans with only corporate guarantors. The Finance Department will provide the Board with reports showing yield, cost of funds, charge-offs, direct costs and overhead allocations, profitability for each product and comparisons to financial goals and budget. 13. Commercial Lending Risk Rating System 1. The Risk Rating System is designed to be a tool to manage the Credit Union\u2019s credit risk and provide an early warning system for negative migration of a loans risk rating. The system also provides for recognition of improvement in a loans risk rating. Each new, reviewed, renewed or modified credit facility is given a risk rating using the Risk Rating Worksheet that takes into consideration factors that materially affect credit quality and decreases subjectivity. The primary accountability for risk rating management resides with the Manager, Commercial Credit Risk. 2. The primary consideration in credit risk assessment is the strength of the primary repayment source. Primary repayment is defined as a sustainable source of cash. This cash, which must be under the borrower\u2019s control, must be reserved, explicitly or implicitly, to cover the debt obligation. In assigning a rating, the Credit Union will assess the strength of the borrower\u2019s repayment capacity. The Credit Union will first assess the paying capacity of the borrower; then, analyze the sound worth of any pledged collateral. Almost all credit transactions are expected to have secondary sources of repayment (collateral, guarantor support, etc.). Despite the secondary support, the rating assessment, until default has occurred or is highly probable, is generally based on the expected strength of the primary repayment source. 3. The risk rating scale has numerical ratings from 1 through 9. Refer to ACU-03-007 attached. The risk rating scale is as follows: 1. Superior (Substantially Risk Free): Excellent business credit with superior management, liquidity, debt capacity and collateral coverage. Loan is more than likely secured by cash with the Credit Union. 2. Excellent (Minimal Risk): Above average business credit with very good management, liquidity, debt capacity and collateral coverage. Excellent access to alternative sources of credit. 3. Good (Modest Risk): Average business credit with good management, liquidity, debt capacity and collateral coverage. Very good access to alternative sources of credit. 4. Acceptable (Average Risk): Acceptable business credit with good management. Acceptable debt capacity, although nearly fully leveraged with little excess liquidity. Loans require structuring with adequate covenants for protection. Good access to alternative credit sources. 5. Acceptable/Monitored (Potential Risk): Loans, which possess some credit deficiency or potential weakness, which deserve attention, but which do not yet appear to jeopardize repayment. The key distinctions of an Acceptable/Monitored classification are that the credit characteristics are those of a \u20184\u2019 rated credit that is performing normally, but there is an uncertain level of risk due to such factors as (1) a lack of information about the current condition of the borrower, and/or (2) a documentation defect that could ultimately jeopardize repayment of the loan in full. 6. Special Mention: A special mention business credit has potential weaknesses that deserve management\u2019s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the credit or in the Credit Union\u2019s credit position at some future date. Special mention credits are not adversely classified and do not expose the Credit Union to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. 7. Substandard: A substandard business credit is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Credits so classified must have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Credit Union will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 8. Doubtful: A credit classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. A doubtful credit has a high probability of total or substantial loss, but because of specific pending events that may strengthen the credit, its classification as loss is deferred. 9. Loss: Credits classified loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as asset is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the credit has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless asset even though partial recovery may be affected in the future.

U.S.C 93a and Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform Act of 1989 (FIRREA) requires a financial institution to adopt and maintain written real estate lending policies that are consistent with principles of safety and soundness and reflect consideration of the supervisory real estate lending guidelines. The real estate lending guidelines require an institution\u2019s real estate lending program to include an appropriate real estate appraisal and evaluation program. The Credit Union is committed to a real estate appraisal and evaluation program that complies with the Agencies\u2019 appraisal regulations and guidelines including the Uniform Standards Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP), Inter-agency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines, National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) Regulation (Title 12, Part 722), Regulation B and Regulation Z; and is consistent with safe and sound practices. SCOPE All areas of lending engaged in transactions involving real property, real estate.

GOVERNANCE 1. COO or CLO is responsible for approving and reviewing policies creating an effective real estate appraisal and evaluation program. The program provides for the independence of the ordering, performing and reviewing of appraisals and evaluations; establishes selection standards and procedures to assess and monitor the continued performance of appraisers and individuals who perform evaluations; confirms appraisals comply with the Agencies\u2019 appraisal regulations and are consistent with supervisory guidance; ensures appraisals and evaluations cover sufficient information to support the credit decision; provides for the receipt and review of the appraisal and evaluation report in an appropriate timeframe to expedite the credit decision; develops principles to assess whether an existing appraisal and evaluation can be used to support a subsequent transaction; implements internal controls to promote compliance with these program standards, including those related to monitoring third party arrangements; and, establishes requirements for monitoring collateral values. 2. The CU may grant conditional approvals to prospective borrowers before obtaining appraisals or evaluations; however, a final credit decision will only occur after the CU receives, reviews, and accepts an appraisal or evaluation. 2. INDEPENDENCE 1. The CU has implemented reporting lines independent of loan production for staff that administers the CU\u2019s collateral valuation program including the ordering, reviewing and acceptance of appraisals and evaluations. Appraisers are independent of the loan production and collection processes and have no direct, indirect, or prospective interest, financial or otherwise, in the property or transaction. These standards of independence also apply to individuals who perform evaluations. 2. This policy establishes explicit practices for communication between the CU\u2019s collateral valuation staff and an appraiser or individual performing an evaluation, to make sure independence is preserved and promotes timely and proper communications. The CU may exchange information with appraisers and persons who perform evaluations, which may include giving the property\u2019s address, description and other relevant information and providing a copy of the sales contract for a purchase transaction. However, the CU will not directly or indirectly coerce, influence, or otherwise encourage an appraiser or an individual who performs an evaluation to misstate or misrepresent the value of the property. The CU may request the appraiser or individual performing an evaluation to: Consider further information about the specified property or about comparable properties. Offer additional supporting information about the basis for a valuation. Amend factual errors in an appraisal. 3. The CU will not take the following actions that could compromise the independence of the collateral valuation function: Convey a predetermined, expected, or qualifying estimate of value, or a loan amount or target loan-to-value ratio to an appraiser or individual performing an evaluation. Identify a minimum value requirement for the property that needed to approve the loan or as a condition to ordering the valuation. Condition a person\u2019s compensation on loan consummation. Neglect to reimburse an individual because a property is not valued at a specific amount. Suggest current or future retention of an individual\u2019s services are contingent on the amount at which the appraiser or individual performing an evaluation values a property. Dismiss an individual from consideration for upcoming assignments because a property\u2019s reported market value does not meet a specified threshold. 4. After obtaining an appraisal or evaluation, the CU may find it necessary to obtain another appraisal or evaluation of a property, at which time the CU will select the most credible appraisal or evaluation rather than the appraisal or evaluation stating the highest value. 3. APPRAISER AND EVALUATION SELECTION 1. The CU\u2019s collateral valuation program establishes standards to select, evaluate and monitor the performance of appraisers and individuals who perform evaluations to include the following: The individual selected possesses the requisite education, expertise, and experience to capably finish the job. The work performed by appraisers and individuals providing evaluation services receives a second review by a qualified individual. The individual selected is able to give an unbiased opinion. The individual selected is independent and with no direct, indirect, or prospective interest, financial or otherwise, in the property or the transaction. The appraiser selected to perform an appraisal holds the applicable state certification or license, at the time of the assignment. Individuals who perform evaluations will have the correct appraisal or collateral valuation education, expertise and experience important to the type of property being valued. 2. The CU may utilize multiple third-party appraisal management firms to select and hire appraisers and evaluators in conformity with the CU\u2019s appraisal management policy. Should the CU directly select independent appraisers and evaluators, the selection process will be as set forth below. The only exception to this requirement is when the CU uses an appraisal prepared for another financial institution. This may happen from time to time; however, certain conditions must be met. The appraisal must be obtained directly from the financial institution, be assigned to the CU and the CU must determine if the appraisal meets all the requirements set forth in this appraisal policy and regulatory guidelines. 3. When the credit union utilizes an appraisal management company, the company is expected to perform all due diligence and quality control. The credit union will audit the appraisal management company to ensure adherence to credit union policy. When the credit union utilizes an independent appraiser, the credit union must perform all due diligence and quality control. The CU's underwriters are trained to identify appraisal deficiencies, included prohibited discriminatory practices, through the appraisal review process. 4. Under no circumstances will a borrower or a loan production staff recommend an appraiser or an individual to perform an evaluation. The CU\u2019s selection process will ensure a qualified, competent, and independent person is selected to perform a valuation. The CU will maintain documentation to demonstrate the appraiser or individual completing an evaluation is capable, independent and has the expertise for the market, location and type of real property being valued. Moreover, the individual who selects or oversees the selection of appraisers or individuals providing evaluation services is independent from the loan production area. A borrower may notify the CU that a recent appraisal exists, and the CU can request the appraisal directly from the other financial services institution. 5. The CU ensures the appraisal fee is customary and reasonable for a geographic area. The CU reviews rates for the appraisers on rotation and compares the rates to the VA Fee Schedule via the VA website, to ensure current appraiser fees are reasonable. Fees within $100 of the VA fees are acceptable. Restricted appraisals may be accepted in lieu of an evaluation. 4. LIST OF APPROVED APPRAISAL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES AND APPRAISERS 1. The credit union maintains a list of approved appraisal management companies and an approved appraiser list of appraisers when the credit union must directly engage an appraiser for a specific appraisal assignment and has the necessary process in place to update and monitor the list. The credit union has a vendor due diligence process that both appraisal management companies and individual appraisers must satisfy. When an independent appraiser is required, the selection process includes procedures to qualify an appraiser for the list and for monitoring the performance of the appraiser, along with qualifications for continuance of services. Moreover, internal audit reviews this process. 5. LETTERS OF ENGAGEMENT 1. The CU requires written engagement letters upon ordering an appraisal or evaluation for commercial real estate loans. The engagement letter effectively communicates with the appraiser and verifies the CU\u2019s expectations. Moreover, the engagement letter identifies the intended use and user(s) as required by USPAP. The engagement letter is kept in the credit file. The appraisal or evaluation development work will not start until the CU has selected and hired an individual or firm. 6. APPRAISAL EXEMPTIONS 1. For transactions meeting the requirements of the appraisal limit, current extensions of credit or business loan exemptions, the CU is exempt from the appraisal obligation; however, the CU still must, at least, acquire an evaluation consistent with regulatory guidelines, as follows: Appraisal Requirements - refer to \u00a7 34.43 Appraisals required; transactions requiring a State certified or licensed appraiser. Abundance of Caution \u2013 The loan must have sufficient cash flow from the borrower or collateral other than real property. If at any time after the loan is booked, the operating performance or financial position of the borrower declines and the CU determines the real estate will be counted on as a repayment source, an appraisal will be ordered. Loans not Secured by Real Estate \u2013 This applies even if the loan is used to purchase or improve real property. The real property must have no direct impact on the CU\u2019s decision to make a loan, since the CU will not have a legal security interest in the property. Liens for Purposes other than the Real Estate\u2019s Value \u2013 The CU can take liens against real estate without requiring an appraisal to protect legal rights to, or control over, other collateral due to the contributory value of the real estate as a separate asset. Leases \u2013 This applies for operating leases that are not the economic equivalent of a purchase or sale of the leased real estate. The CU must obtain appraisals for capital leases since the real estate interest is of sufficient size to be called an asset of the lessee for GAAP purposes. Renewals, Refinancing and Other Subsequent Transactions \u2013 The CU will support an evaluation for renewals, refinances, and other subsequent transaction rather than appraisals under the following conditions: There is no evident and material change in market conditions or physical elements of the property that may endanger the sufficiency of the CU\u2019s real estate collateral protection after the transaction, even with the advancement of new monies. No advancement of new monies is given to the borrower, other than what is needed to cover practical closing fees. The CU accepts new real estate collateral in a loan workout situation that improves the collectability of the credit or decreases the CU\u2019s risk of loss, either an appraisal or an evaluation should be obtained even if it is obtained after the workout happens and the CU perfects its security interest. Transactions for Real Estate Notes \u2013 This applies to transactions including the purchase sale, investment in, exchange of, or extension of credit collateralized by a loan or interest in a loan, pooled loans, or interests in real property, including mortgage-backed securities. If the individual note or real estate interest has already had an appropriate appraisal at origination, the CU does not need to obtain a new appraisal. Transactions Insured or Guaranteed by United States Government Agency or Government Sponsored Agency \u2013 These transactions should have already met the underwriting requirements (including appraisal requirements) of the federal insurer or guarantor. Refer to SBA loans guidelines. Transaction Qualifying for Sale to or meeting the Appraisal Standards of a United States Government Agency or Sponsored Agency \u2013 These transactions include residential real estate in which the appraisal conforms to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac appraisal standards. If the CU relies on this exemption, the CU will maintain sufficient documentation confirming the transaction qualifies. 7. MINIMUM APPRAISAL CRITERIA 1. Minimum regulatory appraisal criteria include the following: All appraisals comply with USPAP but also must comply with the Agencies\u2019 appraisal regulations, whichever is stricter. All appraisals must be written and include enough information and analysis to support the CU\u2019s decision to accept the transaction. The CU must obtain an appraisal that is suitable for the specific transaction, considering risk and complexity. There will be sufficient detail to comprehend the appraiser\u2019s analysis and opinion of the real estate market value. Per USPAP Scope of Work Rule, appraisers are accountable for the scope of work to be done in providing an opinion of the property\u2019s market value. However, the CU will make sure the scope of work is sufficient for the assignment. The CU will not limit the scope of the appraiser\u2019s inspection, research or information used to determine the property\u2019s condition and important market elements. All appraisers must analyze, apply and report correct deductions and discounts when specifying an estimate of market value founded on demand for real estate in the future. All appraisals must be based upon the definition of market value, as described in the appraisal regulation. The definition of market value assumes the price is not affected by undue stimulus, which would allow the value of real property to be increased by favorable financing or seller concessions. Value opinions such as \u201cgoing concern value,\u201d \u201cvalue in use,\u201d or a special value to specific property user may not be used as market value. An appraisal may contain separate opinions of such values so long as they are clearly identified and disclosed. The CU will require the estimate of market value as the real property\u2019s actual physical state, use and zoning as of the actual date of the appraiser\u2019s opinion of value. For a transaction financing construction or renovation of a structure, the CU will request an appraiser include the property\u2019s present market value in \u201cas in\u201d condition, and its future market value at completion and/or estimated future market value when stabilized. Estimated future market value will be based upon present and realistic probable market conditions and the CU will expect a point of reference to the market conditions and time frame. All transactions for higher risk real estate will require an appraisal. These types of transactions include loans with combined loan-to-value ratios exceeding the supervisory guidelines; complex and unusual properties; real estate outside the CU\u2019s normal lending area; extensions of credit with more than normal risk to the CU; and borrowers with high-risk qualities. It is unacceptable for an appraiser to develop a valuation conclusion \"based either partially or completely on the sex, race, color, religion, handicap [disability], national origin, familial status, or other protected classes of either the prospective owners or occupants of the subject property or the present owners or occupants of the properties in the vicinity of the subject property. During appraisal review, LENDER will determine if the appraisal is objective, limiting descriptions to objective features of the neighborhood. LENDER will contact the appraisal management company for appraisal revisions when it determines the descriptions are subjective rather than objective. The AQM list, accessible to approved GSE sellers and servicers, lists appraisers whose appraisals are subject to 100% review or are no longer accepted by GSE. Once GSE approved, LENDER will compare appraiser information against the AQM list to ensure the appraiser has not been flagged or prohibited by GSE. LENDER will also utilize GSE CU flags and messages, including triggers for potential over-valuation risk, appraisal quality risk, and property eligibility risk. feedback messages to determine if GSE has identified any appraisal red flags requiring intensified scrutiny during appraisal review. 8. APPRAISAL DEVELOPMENT 1. Appraisals will reflect the degree to which the real estate is identified and inspected, the nature and level of information studied, and the final assessment used to come to an appropriate conclusion. The appraiser will make disclosure as to whether they had previously examined the property. The CU is responsible for attaining an appraisal that has complete information and analysis to properly substantiate the final decision and take on the transaction. To make sure an appraisal is sufficient for the main purpose, the CU will communicate the appraisal expectations to the appraiser. As previously stated in this policy, communications will consist of conferring the Scope of Work and laying the foundation for the engagement letter. These discussions will comply with this policy regarding independence and will not impact, in any way, the appraiser\u2019s decision. The CU will not let reduced fees or timeliness influence the appraisal appointee decision. Under the Scope of Work provision of USPAP, each appraiser will identify the problem to be solved, determine, and perform the scope of work necessary to develop credible assignment results and disclose the Scope of Work in the report. 2. The appraiser will determine the most relevant valuation approaches. The appraiser needs to examine and resolve the information from all value approaches to come to a final estimated market value. The appraisal will also consist of a narrative on market conditions to include important data on real estate value trends and demand and supply components. The appraisal will reveal consideration of the real estate\u2019s sales history and a judgment as to the highest and best use of the real estate. Per USPAP requirements, the appraiser will divulge if the specific real estate was inspected and if any additional individuals were significantly involved in aiding the appraiser who signed the final appraisal. 9. APPRAISAL DEDUCTIONS AND DISCOUNTS 1. The CU, as part of the Agencies\u2019 appraisal regulation requirements, will ensure an appraiser analyzes and conveys proper deductions and discounts for intended construction/renovation, partially leased structures, and non-market lease terms. These types of transactions require an appraiser to include the market value of the real estate, which needs to show the property\u2019s real tangible state, use and zoning description (\u2018as is\u2019 value), as of the present date. 2. Deductions and discounts for categories described above are as follows: Construction/Renovation \u2013 The CU will require the appraiser to establish an \u2018as is\u2019 and \u2018as completed\u2019 market value. Partially Leased Structure \u2013 The CU will require the appraiser to consider deductions and discounts to reflect the partial leasing status of the building and comment that the property has not realized stabilized occupancy. Non-market Lease Terms \u2013 The CU will require the appraiser to explain the ownership interest of the property being appraised, why lease terms are not at current market value and what leases are currently in place. 10. APPRAISAL REPORTS 1. The CU will consider the risk, size and complexity of the prospective transactions and collateral before deciding the appropriate appraisal report format to be stated in the appraisal engagement letter. The appraisal report must have enough detail to let the CU make an appropriate credit decision. Enough detailed information will consist of the disclosure of research and analysis done and explanation of any omission of information typical of the type of appraisal ordered. The CU will use a narrative appraisal report, which according to the USPAP definition, \u201csummarizes all information significant to the solution of an appraisal problem while still providing sufficient information to enable the client and intended user(s) to understand the rationale for the opinions and conclusions in the report. \u201cRestricted Use\u2019 appraisal reports can be used in place of an evaluation, since this type of report only briefly states information but is sufficient for loans that qualify for an evaluation. 11. EVALUATION DEVELOPMENT 1. The CU will use evaluations consistent with regulatory guidelines and safe and sound practices. Evaluations will verify the CU\u2019s conclusion to engage in a transaction. The evaluation will give a reliable estimate of the market value of the collateral before the CU decides to enter into a transaction. Real estate transactions under the regulatory thresholds (as outlined previously) will require state certified or licensed appraiser completed appraisals. The CU requires residential real estate transactions under the regulatory thresholds, and according to risk, have a minimum of either an AVM, drive-by property appraisal report, or a full interior/exterior appraisal report on respective GSE forms. 12. EVALUATION CONTENT 1. The CU requires the contents of an evaluation to hold enough information to assess and support the final credit decision. The evaluation will be documented and held in the credit file and should contain, at least, the following information: Location of the real estate. Real estate description, along with its current and future use. Estimate of the real estate\u2019s \u2018as is\u2019 market value, use and zoning description, as of the completed evaluation date and any restrictive conditions. Method(s) used to estimate the market value, in a narrative form. Whether or not a physical inspection was performed and the reason for that decision. Analysis that was performed and supporting data used for the valuation, in a narrative form. All sources of data needed to produce the value are listed and include external information (market sales databases, public tax, land records, etc.); information specific to the data (sales, tax assessment, comparable sales, etc.); inspection of property; photographs, neighborhood depiction; and/or area economic situation. Preparer information such as name, contact data and signature. 13. VALIDITY OF APPRAISALS AND EVALUATIONS 1. The CU does allow the use of an existing appraisal or evaluation to confirm an established transaction, in some situations. The CU will decide whether an existing appraisal or evaluation still reflects the present market value of the real estate. The CU\u2019s standards for this decision will be contingent on the condition of the real estate and market area, and the risk of the transaction. The CU will document, in the loan file, the CU\u2019s analysis and support to continue to use the existing appraisal or evaluation for the new transaction. However, a new appraisal or evaluation must be obtained if the following conditions exist: The net operating income of the property shows a decreasing trend. The lease-up or sell-out of the property has not met the original projections. The property has had obvious physical changes (fire, wind damage, major renovations, etc.) The property continues to remain vacant for an extended period. The highest and best use has changed on an owner-occupied property The project has changed (condominium to apartment, single tenant to multi-tenant). The tax assessment value has declined. An additional legal or financial burden encumbers the property, such as the discovery of environmental risk or the creation of an easement. Instability in the local economy. Alteration of terms and obtainability of financing. Natural disasters. Changes in the level of supply for competing real estate. Alterations in original economic and market estimates (capitalization rates and lease terms). Alterations in zoning, construction materials or technology. 2. Appraisals for other real estate owned will be reviewed at least annually and management will determine if a new appraisal should be ordered. 14. REVIEWING APPRAISALS AND EVALUATIONS 1. As a component of the CU\u2019s credit approval practices and before a final credit determination, the CU will review the appraisal or evaluation reports to make sure they comply with USPAP and the Agencies\u2019 appraisal regulations, supervisory guidelines, and this Policy. 2. A review of the appraisal or evaluation needs to determine the reasonableness, appropriateness and supportiveness of the valuation methods, assumptions, and information sources. The CU requires all commercial loans over $250,000 to have a third party, second review by a Board approved designated state certified appraiser. The CU will use the findings from the review to screen and evaluate the capabilities of approved appraisers. The second reviewer is not allowed to make changes to the value decision on the original appraisal, they can provide a second opinion on the market value and the CU can rely on the second opinion of the reviewer, if the second reviewer is a state certified or licensed appraiser and the appraisal complies with USPAP. 3. The CU's Reconsideration of Value (ROV) Procedure follows NCUA, FHFA and Agency guidelines. 4. The CU\u2019s appraisal and evaluation process will at a minimum include the following: Communicate the independence, educational and training requirements, and responsibilities of the reviewer. Ascertain the depth of the review. Create a process for settling errors. Establish documentation principals for the review and error resolutions. 5. The CU has established qualification standards for individuals qualified to review appraisals and evaluations. Individuals reviewing appraisals are independent of the transaction and have no direct or indirect interest, financial or otherwise, in the real estate or transaction and have no influential relationship with credit production employees. Reviewers will also have the necessary education, knowledge, and capabilities to complete the review equal to the complexity of the transaction, type of property and market area, and assess that the appraisal contains the appropriate information for the CU to make an informed credit decision. 6. The CU will use appraisals from other institutions from time to time; however, the CU will decide if the appraisal complies with the appraisal regulations and is, thus, acceptable. The same standards will apply to this appraisal process, as it will to the normal appraisal process. The CU will review the other institution\u2019s appraisal with the same level of judgment as if the appraisal were obtained directly for like real estate and will document the review. Documentation of the review will support the credit union\u2019s reliance on the appraisal. The CU will verify the appraiser was hired directly by the other financial institution (obtain a copy of the engagement letter), had no direct, indirect, or future interest, financial or otherwise in the real estate or transaction and the financial institution directly ordered the appraisal and not the borrower (per a copy of the engagement letter). The CU will not accept an appraisal that has been changed by the appraiser with the aim of hiding the original. 7. The CU\u2019s policy for documenting the review of appraisals will be held in the credit files. The documentation will explain the resolution of any appraisal weaknesses, including details for obtaining and relying on the second appraisal. 15. THIRD PARTY ARRANGEMENTS 1. The CU maintains responsibility for identifying and monitoring risks relating to third party arrangements between approved appraisers and evaluators. The CU does engage third party reviewers for appraisals. The CU\u2019s third-party reviewers are independent, knowledgeable, experienced, and certified or licensed to perform a second appraisal valuation. 16. PROGRAM COMPLIANCE 1. The CU upholds an effective appraisal and evaluation process. The process includes maintenance of appropriate controls, verification, and testing to make sure appraisals and evaluations afford reliable market values. The process also maintains independence of the individual ordering appraisals and evaluations from the lending staff; makes sure the selection of appraisers and evaluators are qualified and knowledgeable for the task; tests the quality of appraisals and evaluations review practices and take action if there are problems; and maintains a process to report deficiencies in appraisals and evaluations that are not corrected or addressed and/or evidence of unacceptable appraisal practices. In addition, if there are suspected overt violations of anti-discrimination laws, the CU will report to the appropriate state appraiser regulatory officials (state appraiser licensing agency) . 2. Collateral Value Monitoring The CU monitors the loan portfolio collateral risk and individual loan collateral risk. The CU\u2019s policies communicate the need to attain current collateral valuation data to comprehend the CU\u2019s collateral position over the life of a loan and to appropriately manage and monitor the risk in the portfolio. Moreover, the CU\u2019s policies communicate the need to attain current valuation data for collateral on existing modified or workout credits. 3. Existing Credits (Modified and/or Workouts) At the time the CU determines an existing credit needs to be modified or be placed in a workout process, consideration of current collateral valuation data will be assessed to ascertain the risk to the collateral. When an existing loan is modified, the CU has determined the credit involves limited change(s) in the terms of the note or loan agreement and these changes do not unfavorably impact the CU\u2019s collateral protection after the modification and does not create a new real estate-related financial transaction, per the Agencies\u2019 appraisal regulations. The CU is not required to obtain a new appraisal nor evaluation to comply with the regulation but will comprehend and document any collateral risk. Loan modifications will consider practical underwriting principles and be in accordance with safe and sound lending practices. When an existing loan is in workout, the CU has determined the credit involves a significant impact on the CU\u2019s collateral protection. A workout loan that results in a new real estate-related financial transaction consists of a modification, renewal or extension of loan terms, new monies, or a restructuring with or without concessions. If the loan workout does not consist of new monies (not including reasonable closing costs) and the CU determines market values have not changed, the CU will perform an evaluation. Otherwise, the CU must obtain a qualified appraisal. The CU will document and validate the reasons for not getting an updated appraisal or using an evaluation in lieu of an appraisal. 17. High Priced Mortgage Loan Appraisals 1. The HPML Appraisal rule contains overlays for elements that are covered in other areas of our operating policies and procedures. 2. When the credit union originates a covered HPML we will: Disclose to consumers within three business days after receiving the consumers\u2019 applications that they are entitled to a free copy of any appraisal the creditor orders and can hire their own appraiser at their own expense for their own use. (\u00a7 1026.35(c)(5)) Obtain a written appraisal performed by a certified or licensed appraiser in conformity with the USPAP and Title XI of FIRREA and its implementing regulations. (\u00a7\u00a7 1026.35(c)(1)(i) and 35(c)(3)(i)) Have the appraiser visit the interior of the property and provide a written report (\u00a7 1026.35(c)(3)) Deliver copies of appraisals to applicants no later than three business days before consummation (\u00a7 1026.35(c)(6)(ii)) Appraisal Delivery upon request: We already automatically provide a copy of the written appraisal as part of our Regulation B compliance. Our closers check to make sure the borrower receives a copy 3 business days prior to closing as part of our Mortgage Disclosure Improvement Act. Interior Inspection: We require all appraisers to be licensed as part of our standard USPAP and FIRREA compliance. If the appraiser cannot meet the delivery time to provide sufficient advance copy of the appraisal, the borrower may provide a written waiver of the 3-day advance copy. 3. General Requirements for Appraisals The report must: identify the creditor, the property, and the interest being appraised analyze the contract price address conditions in the property\u2019s neighborhood address the condition of the property and improvements provide the valuation approach and a reconciliation provide an opinion of the property\u2019s market value and effective date indicate a physical property visit of the property interior USPAP and FIRREA certification 18. Disclosures and Delivery to Applicants 1. In accordance with 12 CFR \u00a7 1002 the credit union will provide applicants with copies of all appraisals and other written valuations developed in connection with an application for credit secured by a first lien on a dwelling. 12 CFR \u00a7 1002.14(a)(1); and notify applicants in writing of their right to receive copies of all appraisals and written valuations developed in connection with their application within three business days of receipt of an application. 12 CFR \u00a7 1002.14(a)(2). 19. COMPLAINT REFERRALS 1. The CU will file a complaint with the appropriate state appraiser regulatory officials (state appraiser licensing agency) when it suspects a state certified or licensed appraiser fails to comply with USPAP, state laws or engages in other unethical or unprofessional conduct. Before an official complaint is lodged, the issue is brought to the attention of senior management and/or the CU\u2019s attorney to ensure the complaint warrants further action. The CU provides an email address to applicants/borrowers directing them to the CU\u2019s audit department, to submit complaints regarding the CU\u2019s improper influencing or attempted improper influencing of an appraisal or the appraisal process. Additionally, applicants/borrowers will be informed they should file a complaint when a state certified or licensed appraiser fails to comply with USPAP, state laws or engages in other unethical or unprofessional conduct. 2. A SAR is filed with FinCEN if fraud is suspected, or an identified transaction meets the SAR filing criteria.

Co-borrowers and guarantors are subject to the same limitations of all debts they are financially responsible for, regardless of the capacity in which they have signed. The purpose and goal in offering a Managed Risk Lending Policy is to help as many members as possible live life, dream big and achieve financial success. AmeriCU Credit Union recognizes that certain members represent more risk than others. We will not grant loans where the estimated probability of repayment is doubtful. However, we also recognize the importance of managed risk and realize that many of our members are being charged extremely high rates by other lenders. Through a managed risk-based lending program, we can help these members to rebuild their credit and save them a substantial amount of money. SCOPE Lending DEFINITIONS Co-borrower (co-maker): This individual\u2019s income is added to (commingled with) the applicants income in order to meet the income requirements of the loan. The total income of both individuals is used to qualify for the loan. Co- borrowers have to \"share the benefits\" of the proceeds (loan). A co-borrower is jointly and equally liable for repayment of the loan. A co- borrower must be a member of the credit union. (The co-borrower does not need to be joint on shares within the loan account as long as they are prime member on own account.) Co-signer (guarantor): While the credit score of this individual will be considered in meeting the credit history requirements of the loan, their income is not added with the applicant\u2019s income. Loan rate is _not_ based on Co-signer's score. Both the primary borrower and the co- signer have to individually qualify for the income requirements of the loan. The guarantor does not \u201cshare the benefits\u201d of the proceeds (loan). If the primary borrower is unable to meet the loan obligations, then the co- signer is responsible for making payments on the loan. A cosigner (guarantor) does not have to be a member of the credit union. Collateral Owner: When an individual is not on a loan and their property is used as collateral they are placed on the loan as a Collateral Owner. They are not on the loan, and are not entitled to any loan information without property authority from the member or a POA. A Non Signer Form can be used in this situation. A Collateral Owner does not have to be a member of AmeriCU. RESPONSIBILITIES The Chief Lending Officer or Senior Vice President Lending will determine the operating conditions of the Managed Risk Lending Program. AmeriCU recognizes that there are several key types of risks in the granting of loans. However, the primary loan risks being addressed in this Management Policy are: Credit Risk Interest Rate Risk \u2013 which contains a term component of the risk 1. Credit Risk : The credit union will use a combination of judgment and credit scoring models in granting loans. The scoring models will be used as a tool to assist in the loan decision making process and will be used to determine individual loan rates (which will be based on overall risk.) Rates to be charged on loans will be consistent with the risk of default as predicted by the member's credit history and credit quality factors. It is the policy and practice of AmeriCU not to discriminate, which is the reason we have selected the Vantage4 Score to assist in our credit decision processes. The Vantage4 Score is a consumer credit scoring model introduced by the three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion) as an alternative to the FICO (Fair Isaac Corporation) score. This model uses machine learning techniques and trended credit data to reflect changes in credit behaviors over time, providing a predictive depiction of a consumer's creditworthiness. In addition, the Vantage4 model uses 6 key factors as opposed to the five offered in the traditional FICO score. These factors include: Payment History, Age and Mix of Credit, Credit Utilization, New Credit, Credit Balance, and Available Credit.Thus, the credit union believes this model is a better predictor of default for credit union members than a traditional FICO based model. A third party, not the credit union, provides the score that determines the rate we will charge our member. The credit score model used will be an empirically derived model that is validated by the provider on a regular basis, for examples: the FICO model is developed by Fair Isaac and Company; the Vantage4 score is developed by Experian, Trans Union and Equifax collaboratively. Our loan rates will be reflective of the credit bureau score used at the time of loan origination. When determining the rate to charge, if two or more scores are offered, the credit union will adhere to the following: In the event that there are two borrowers, the grade of the paper will be based on the highest score unless the higher score has no income, then the rate is based on the applicant with income. In the event that there is a co-signer/guarantor, the grade of the paper will be based on the highest score of the borrower or co-borrower, not the score of the co-signer/guarantor. Borrower/co-borrower should be limited to same address, or immediate family members (i.e. mother/father, sister/brother, grandparent). For titled and UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) vehicles only, both borrowers must be on title to the collateral. Co-Signers (Guarantors) are only to be used in the event that the borrower/co-borrower has a weak or shallow credit file (for example: less than two years of credit history and less than four trade lines, excluding student loans). Co-signers should not be used to compensate for a borrower and/or co-borrower's poor previous credit history or lack of capacity to repay the loan under consideration. (Reference Policy ACU-03-009 for definition of co-signer and co-borrower) In the event there is no credit score, the grade of the paper will be based on the lowest score tier, with the exception of specialized loan products/promotions. Zero Score credit tier will be the same as the credit union's lowest grade of paper. If two Credit Bureau reports are obtained, resulting in two different scores, the credit union may choose the score/report which is most indicative of the member's credit history. 2. Interest Rate Risk The credit union will be protected against interest rate risk by having adequate percentage loan products in the portfolio with tiered rates based on credit risk, collateral risk and term risk as well as having variable rate products where demand allows for them. These products will help us maximize our portfolio income as rates fluctuate. The interest rate corresponding with paper tiers is outlined on the rate schedules based on loan type. Interest will be charged at an annual Percentage Rate (APR). Any special pricing or relationship pricing will be a part of the rate guidelines. For marketing promotions and membership development promotions, the credit union may offer special rates and terms outside of the standard rate matrix. This is considered a normal function of our marketing and membership development efforts and these offers are not considered rate exceptions.

SCOPE _CLO , Compliance Officer_ DEFINITIONS The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994, the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012, the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act, and 12 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) 760 of the NCUA (National Credit Union Association) Rules and Regulations all address flood insurance responsibilities. Oversight of the Flood Disaster Protection Act (FDPA) and the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). There are four principal objectives of the FDPA: 1. Provide flood insurance to owners of improved real estate located in SFHAs of communities participating in the NFIP. 2. Require communities to enact measures designed to reduce or avoid future flood losses as a condition for making federally subsidized flood insurance available. 3. Require federal financial regulatory agencies to adopt regulations prohibiting their regulated lending institutions from making, increasing, extending or renewing a loan secured by improved real estate or a mobile home located or to be located in an SFHA of a Page 2 of 14 community participating in the NFIP, unless the property securing the loan is covered by flood insurance. 4. Require federal agencies, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs (VA) not to subsidize, insure, or guarantee any loan if the property securing the loan is in an SFHA of a community not participating in the NFIP. The FDPA is applicable when a lien is taken as security for a loan transaction on improved real estate (a building) or a mobile home that is affixed to a permanent foundation. This includes both consumer and commercial transactions. RESPONSIBILITY The CLO will serve as the responsible manager for overall compliance of the FDPA. The Compliance Officer will assist in administering and monitoring compliance with this Act. Credit Union Compliance Officer may perform periodic FDPA audits to ensure compliance with certain provisions of the regulation. In addition, an annual audit of this area will be conducted by a third-party compliance consulting company. The results of any audits will be reported to the Compliance Committee. Training will be conducted, where needed, for pertinent associates to enhance knowledge of the regulatory requirements and procedures to follow in maintaining compliance with the FDPA. To ensure that a substantive level of compliance is maintained, the following requirements have been established by implementation of this Policy Statement: The Credit Union will NOT make, increase, extend, or renew any loan secured by improved real estate that is located in SFHA in a participating community unless the building and any personal property securing the loan is covered for the life of the loan by flood insurance. The only exceptions will be if a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) or Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) has been issued by FEMA for the property (borrower must obtain flood insurance in the interim until the FEMA review is finalized). Credit Union may make conventional loans secured by mortgages on buildings and mobile homes in SFHAs in \u201cnonparticipating\u201d communities, but the Credit Union should carefully evaluate the financial risk and safety and soundness prior to originating such loans if flood insurance cannot be obtained. Prior to originating a covered loan, the Credit Union will determine whether a building or mobile home used to secure a loan is located in a SFHA through the use of the Standard Flood Hazard Determination form (currently outsourced to a third-party provider, yet ultimate responsibility of Credit Union). The Credit Union is allowed to pass on a \u201creasonable fee\u201d to borrowers when a flood determination is ordered, including \u201clife-of-loan\u201d charges. The Credit Union shall ensure that borrowers whose loans are secured by a building located in a SFHA are provided and acknowledge receipt of the required Notice of Special Flood Hazards and Availability of Federal Disaster Relief Assistance within a reasonable period of time before completion of the loan transaction. The Credit Union will investigate any flood zone discrepancies between the flood zone determination form and insurance policy and handle per regulatory guidance. While flood insurance is not required for any structure in a flood zone that is detached from the primary residential structure and does not serve as a residence, management may require flood insurance on such structure on a case-by-case basis. Documented proof of an adequate amount of flood insurance will be required prior to closing. The Credit Union shall ensure that the amount of flood insurance must be at least equal to the lesser of (1) the outstanding principal balances of all liens, (2) the maximum amount available under the NFIP, or (3) the full insurable value of the building which is the same as 100 percent replacement cost value for residential property and actual cash value for commercial property. A flood insurance calculation worksheet will can be utilized to determine the proper amount of coverage. The Credit Union will ensure that the flood insurance policy does not exceed the maximum deductible allowed by law, and loans with higher deductibles may require management approval. For construction loans, the Credit Union requires adequate flood insurance to be in place at the time of the foundation drawdown; a monitoring system is in place to ensure flood insurance is obtained at that time. The Credit Union must notify the flood insurance provider of the identity of the servicer of the loan and any subsequent assignment or transfer of a loan to another lender or servicer. During the term of each covered loan, the Credit Union will ensure that adequate flood insurance is maintained or added if the Credit Union becomes aware that the building involved subsequently becomes part of a SFHA (i.e., through FEMA flood zone changes). The Credit Union will ensure that proper force placement procedures of flood insurance are in place if it is determined that the building securing the loan is not covered by flood insurance or is in an amount less than required by law. While the Credit Union cannot force place until 45 days after notification of a lapse, the Credit Union may charge the borrower for the cost of premiums and fees incurred for coverage beginning on the date on which flood insurance coverage lapsed. In addition, the Credit Union will cancel a forced-place policy within 30 days of receipt of proof of flood insurance by the borrower and refund any premiums and fees during any period overlap. If flood insurance monitoring is outsourced to a third-party vendor, the Credit Union is still responsible for full compliance with the regulation. Periodic reviews may take place to ensure compliance. If Credit Union requires the escrowing of taxes, insurance premiums, or any other loan fees or charges for covered loans, the Credit Union is required to escrow for premiums and fees for flood insurance. Management is aware that civil money penalties for non-compliance are $2,000 per occurrence with no annual cap on the maximum that a financial institution can be penalized. Other supervisory actions may include a file search, enforcement action, and impact to compliance rating. FDPA provides for penalties for violations of: Escrow requirements; Notice requirements; and Forced placement requirements.

GENERAL POLICY For the purpose of this policy, a real estate loan is a loan predicated on a security interest in real property, wholly secured by the property being financed. Such loans are to be secured by a perfected first position or second position loan or line with the CU, consisting of a properly executed and recorded security instrument, in favor of the CU. The CU will make purchase money loans, refinance , construction and home equity loans and lines of credit. 1. Non-Discrimination 1. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (Regulation B) prohibits discrimination against, or discourage, any applicant for credit from applying, nor delay a decision upon any application for credit on the basis of: (1) race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age (provided the applicant has capacity to contract); (2) because all or part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program; or (3) because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Protection Act. Mortgage loans require compliance with the following acts: Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA)- (CFPB Regulation X, 12 CFR Part 1024), Fair Housing Act, and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (CFPB Regulation C, 12 CFR Part 1003). 2. It is the Credit Union's policy to observe both the letter and the spirit of the law because it is good business to do so. 2. Anti-Redlining - It is the policy of this Credit Union to consider applicants and properties individually and not to exclude groups of people or areas within our trade area from eligibility for real estate loans. 3. Perfection of Collateral Lien - The Credit Union will require all title holders, and their partners under civil unions or spouses to sign the legal documents (such as mortgage) for the purpose of granting an appropriate lien on the collateral property, and to waive certain property rights established within State law concerning community property, and homestead. 4. Monitoring Data Required - For loans for home purchase or home improvements (or the refinancing of either), the Loan Officer must complete the section of the application for monitoring discriminatory practices either by having the Member complete it or by the Credit Union completing it through visual observation. All aspects of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) will be followed as per the requirements of the Regulation. 5. Portfolio Diversification - To serve our community and at the same time diversify risk, our Credit Union has established policies for the overall composition of the loan portfolio as well as for the major components of the portfolio. 6. Concentrations 1. On an ongoing basis, our Credit Union will monitor the distribution of our real estate portfolio to identify concentrations of credit. Refer to ACU-01-002 Concentration Risk Policy. We will identify potential concentrations of credit by stratifying the portfolio into segments with common risk segments, including in particular by the above defined categories. We will consider the degree of project and portfolio sensitivities to the condition of the general real estate market, and to economic and financial developments in our trade area during the underwriting phase and when assessing risk in the individual credit, in segment of the portfolio and in overall portfolio. As with other concentrations of credit, any concentrations identified within the real estate portfolio will be compared to capital levels to assure the Credit Union\u2019s capital level is maintained at an appropriate level in consideration of the nature of concentration risk. 2. This policy provides for the application of consistent underwriting standards, managed liquidity in the real estate portfolio and effective servicing and oversight, all of which are essential to effective portfolio and concentration risk management. 7. Real Estate Appraisals 1. The Credit Union\u2019s appraisal policy will acknowledge the primary underwriting consideration in the credit decision is the need for the borrowers to have sufficient resources to repay their real estate loans according to reasonable terms. The Credit Union must also consider the value of the underlying real estate collateral. All real estate appraisals will conform to generally accepted appraisal standards as evidenced by the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP). The evaluation will be performed by State-licensed or certified appraisers in accordance with requirements set forth in the regulation and the appraiser will not be permitted to be engaged if they have any interest, direct or indirect, financial, or otherwise within the property. (See ACU-03-014 Appraisal Policy for details) 8. Credit Investigation - Prior to credit decision, all loan applications must have a thorough credit investigation. 9. Loan authorization - limits are set forth in the ACU-01-004 Approval/Authority Limits Policy. 10. Loan collateral types- Owner Occupied, Non Owner Occupied, Primary and Secondary homes. 2. LOAN LIMITS. 1. Maximum Maturity. Loans originated with the intent to sell on the secondary market are limited to maturities of 30 years. Those originated with the intent to retain in portfolio are limited to maturities of 30 years. 2. Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI). Loans with over 80% LTV will require private mortgage insurance (PMI) intended to be sold on the secondary market and/ or held in portfolio. Any deviation from this practice , would be approved by the CLO whether standardized in a portfolio offering or by exception . 3. CREDIT CRITERIA 1. Real estate loan decisions will be based on these primary areas of criteria (1) Capacity, (2) Character, (3) Capital, (4) Collateral, and (5) Conditions. These factors are explained further as follows: 1. Capacity to Repay/Income. The borrower must have sufficient income and liquidity to repay all obligations.Loan Officers are required to calculate the ratio based on the description of indebtedness on the application, business or personal financial statement, and credit investigation. 2. Character/Credit Record. A borrower's general character, integrity, and sense of responsibility to repay debt are indicated in the credit record. While weakness in credit experience can be reason enough for a denial, management ability must also be analyzed and documented. 3. Capital/Net Worth. A borrower's equity in assets is a secondary source of repayment that can be considered for collateralizing loans. Capital may also indicate the borrower's attitude toward fiscal responsibility and debt management. 4. Collateral/Down Payments. Any real estate loan 1 to 4-family with an LTV greater than 80% may require a full underwrite by a mortgage insurance company or government program using newly acquired credit investigation and verification documentation. Real estate programs govern maximum loan-to-value ratios for several types of real estate loans. 5. Conditions/Employment. The condition of the local economy and that of the applicable industry help to determine the stability of the source of repayment. Market conditions, such as price fluctuations and the stability of industry, must be considered. The borrower's salary and employment record help determine the stability of the source of repayment. Length of service, type of occupation, and stability of the employer must be considered. The Loan Officer must use good judgment along with the Credit Union's credit standards and guidelines. 4. QUALIFYING BORROWERS. 1. Qualifying borrowers are those members who demonstrate creditworthiness. Loan officers will consider all criteria outlined in the credit underwriting standards and ability to repay requirements. 5. CREDIT DOCUMENTATION 1. Application and Financial Statement - A signed, written application stating the purpose of the request, the source of repayment, the loan amount, the term, collateral, and description and listing of indebtedness for consumer real estate loan requests and a recent financial statement for all other loans. All real estate loans will include the uniform residential loan application (URLA) according to current federal and state regulations. 2. Credit Reports - A credit report is a supplement to the application. It verifies information supplied by the borrower, co-signer, or guarantor. A report is required on every new Member with no exceptions. A new report is required on existing Members if the previous report is more than 6 months old. In-house investigation of both loan and deposit accounts is required for every loan. 3. Collateral/Title Search - Credit Union regulations require written evidence of merchantable title in the real estate . Therefore, it is necessary for all loans secured by real estate with the purpose of purchase or refinance of the property to have either a title certificate signed by an attorney, or a title insurance policy issued by an approved title insurance company. Home equity loans may be originated utilizing a title search and not require a title insurance policy. 4. REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION. The Credit Union will verify the information it relies on to evaluate a member\u2019s ability to repay the mortgage loan using reasonable reliable third-party records. 1. Completed FNMA/FHCMC application. 2. Recent credit report and employment income verification. 3. Clear title policy issued by a title company. 4. Proof of homeowner's insurance with loss payable to the Credit Union. 5. Deed of trust, recording, and legal description. 6. Completed appraisal report (with pictures) prepared for the Credit Union by a qualified appraiser within 120 days of loan application. All single-family home appraisals will be completed on the Uniform Residential Appraisal Report. 7. Evidence of flood insurance where applicable. 8. Proof of balance of first mortgage (if applicable). 9. Closing statements and disclosures. 6. CREDIT DECISIONS 1. Approval Procedures - All real estate loan applications must be supported by the proper documentation including signed application form, appraisal, credit reports, financial statements, and verifications. Mortgage underwriters with expertise have authority to approve or deny loans within an established authority matrix. For lending limits or exception loans, a second signature from the underwriting manager and or senior management may be required. The Credit Union has adopted a loan approval authority policy; refer to ACU-01-004 Approval/Authority Limits Policy. 2. Notification Requirement of Action Taken 1. Regulation B requires that the Credit Union act on an application within thirty (30) days of application. The Credit Union has the following options upon receipt of a signed URLA; 1. issue a Notice of Incomplete setting forth the additional information/documentation required to complete the application to render a credit decision. The Credit Union may then close the file as incomplete if not received within the time allotted in the Notice of Incomplete. 2. deny the loan request, 3. approve the loan request, 4. deny the original loan terms requested and make a counteroffer, or 5. process a consumer\u2019s request to withdraw the credit application loan request at any time prior to issuing a firm commitment to lend. 3. CREDIT TERMS 1. Portfolio Owner-Occupied 1-To-4 Family Residences 1. 1st mortgage Amortize 30 years 2. Jr. mortgage Amortize 20 years 2. Secondary Market - 1-to-4 family residences -- Per specific Agency guidelines and subject to the Credit Union\u2019s Underwriting Guidelines. 3. Construction Loans \\- 1-to-4 family residential property 12 months construction period; converts to amortizing loan at expiration of the 12 months interest only period unless extended and approved by underwriting. 4. Raw land \\- amortize up to 120 months. 5. Interest Rates - Interest rates are intended to reflect the cost of funds plus the degree of risk, loan reserve requirements, and profit. These rates are quoted via pricing engine within the loan operating system, based on borrowers qualifications. These rates are shared on the credit unions website , with subject to change terms and based on individual borrowers' risk profiles. Our Credit Union also offers ARMs where the interest rate changes in accordance with a stated formula tied to an external interest rate index. 6. 1 to 4 Family Residential Real Estate Loan Pricing 1. Overall, 1 to 4 family owner occupied residential loan pricing will be determined by the CLO and managed by the AVP Secondary Market. These rates are governed by secondary market pricing, afforded to the credit union via secondary market outlets through best effort and mandatory pricing allowances from aggregators/ correspondent lending partners. Loans intended for sale and not held in the Credit Union\u2019s portfolio will be priced based on current market rates that will return to the Credit Union upon sale and delivery of the mortgage loan to the investor or their representative servicer an amount sufficient to yield. 2. Pricing will follow various guidelines set by the investor based on size of loan, applicants credit score, type and condition of the collateral property, type of loan, purpose of loan, difficulty of process such as extended distance from the Credit Union operations center, term of loan, days until expiration, etc. Applicants wishing to apply for a 1 to 4 family residential owner-occupied loan to be held in portfolio at the Credit Union will receive a rate quote from the Credit Union based on the market cost of funds and appropriate margin and costs to offset credit risk, interest rate risk and transaction risk as determined by the Pricing Committee or the CLO. Many of the same factors noted above will have an influence on the pricing offered to the applicant. 3. No loan pricing will ever factor in variables associated with Regulation B and Fair Lending non-discrimination classes of (1) Gender, (2) Marital status, (3) Childbearing intentions, (4) Part-time income, (5) Receipt of alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments, (6) Race, (7) Skin color, (8) Religion, (9) National origin, (10) Age, (11) Disability, and (12) Geographic basis. 7. LOAN DISCLOSURES AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE 1.

The proceeds of a mortgage loan shall be disbursed by the Credit Union\u2019s official check, wire transfer, or credited to the Member\u2019s Credit Union account. No disbursements are to be made by cash. It will be the policy of the Credit Union to use a title company for all disbursement on construction loans. The Credit Union may close real estate equity and refinance loan based on conditions and requirements found in the title search reports. For closings performed by a title company, the mortgage must be delivered for recording by the title company, and they must be able to advise the Credit Union that the lien will be insured before any funds are disbursed. 9. ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS AND LIABILITY 1. DETERMINATION AND NOTICE OF FLOOD HAZARDS. The Credit Union will comply with NCUA Part 760 regarding the determination of loans in areas having special flood hazards. 1. Determination. For all loans made, increased, extended or renewed that are secured by a building or mobile home located or to be located in a special flood hazard area, the Credit Union will complete the standard flood hazard determination form developed by the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). This applies to loan originations, extensions, refinances, and renewals. The Credit Union will retain a copy of the completed form for as long as the Credit Union owns the loan. 2. Fee. The Credit Union may charge a reasonable fee for determining whether the building securing the loan or mobile home is, or will be located, in a special flood hazard area. The portion of the cost for the life-of-loan monitoring will be disclosed as a finance charge pursuant to Regulation Z. 3. Notice. If the building securing the loan or mobile home is in a special flood hazard area, the Credit Union must: 1. Notify the borrower and the loan servicer of the special flood hazard within a reasonable time before completion of the transaction, the requirement for the purchase of flood insurance, whether flood insurance coverage is available from the National Flood Insurance Program, and whether federal disaster relief assistance may be available in the event of flooding. The Credit Union will retain a written receipt by the borrower and the loan servicer of this notice for as long as the Credit Union owns the loan. Notice may be provided to the servicer electronically. 2. Notify the Administrator of FEMA, or their designee, of the loan servicer. To ensure that the insurance policy is maintained in full force, the Credit Union will send this notice to the insurance carrier that issued the insurance policy so that the mortgagee endorsement can be updated. The Credit Union will notify the Administrator of FEMA of any change in the servicer of a loan within sixty (60) days after the effective date of the change. 2. FLOOD INSURANCE. The Credit Union will not make a loan secured by a building, or mobile home on a permanent foundation, that is located in a special flood hazard area for which flood insurance is available, unless the building is covered by flood insurance for the term of the loan. This applies to all originations, extensions, refinances, and renewals of loans over $5,000 or with a repayment term greater than a year. The credit union is not required to obtain flood insurance for a structure (used for personal, family or household purposes) that is a part of a residential property, but detached from the primary residential structure and does not serve as a residence. 1. Term. The borrower must maintain flood insurance for the term of the loan, unless flood map revisions determine that the underlying collateral is no longer in a designated flood hazard area. 2. Coverage. The policy amount must cover the loan amount or the maximum amount available under the National Flood Insurance Program, whichever is less. 3. Escrow. If flood insurance is required, the Credit Union will escrow the flood insurance premiums, unless an exception applies. The escrow account will be subject to the escrow requirements of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA). Following receipt of notice from the Administrator of FEMA or other provider of flood insurance that premiums are due, the Credit Union will ensure that payment is made to the insurance provider from the escrow account on the date when such premiums are due. 4. Notification; Forced Placement. The Credit Union will determine whether flood insurance is required and promptly notify prospective borrowers of the need to acquire flood insurance within 45 days, at the borrower\u2019s expense. If the borrower fails to provide evidence of flood insurance within 45 days of notification, the Credit Union will purchase flood insurance for borrower at borrower's expense. If the borrower subsequently obtains sufficient flood insurance coverage, within 30 days of receipt of confirmation, the credit union will notify the insurance provider to terminate any insurance purchased by the credit union and refund to the borrower all premiums and fees paid by the borrower during the time both the borrower\u2019s flood insurance and the credit union-paid flood insurance were in effect. 5. Records. The Credit Union will maintain records documenting the method used to determine the need for flood insurance and notices sent to borrowers. 6. Private Flood Insurance. The Credit Union will accept private flood insurance that meets the definition within NCUA Rules (760.2). In order to confirm the policy meets the definition the Credit Union will ensure that within the policy or as an endorsement, the following statement is included: \u201cThis policy meets the definition of private flood insurance contained in 42 U.S.C. 4012a(b)(7) and the corresponding regulation.\u201d 1. The Credit Union has discretion in accepting a flood insurance policy that is not issued under the National Flood Insurance Program and that does not meet the definition of \u201cprivate flood insurance\u201d within NCUA Rules (760.2) if; (1) coverage is provided in the amount required, (2) is issued by an insurer that is licensed, admitted, or otherwise approved to engage in insurance by the state regulator or jurisdiction in which the property will be insured, (3) covers both the Credit Union (as the mortgagee) and mortgagor(s) as loss payees (exception for cooperatives and homeowners associations), and (4) provides sufficient protection of the loan, consistent with general safety and soundness principles and the Credit Union documents conclusions regarding that sufficiency in writing. 10. CONSTRUCTION or REHAB LOANS 1. The Credit Union offers short-term loans to qualifying members for construction of their primary and/ or secondary residence. In obtaining a construction loan, the member-borrower assumes financial responsibility for all costs involved in the construction of the home and all fees charged to the Credit Union. As a general rule, permanent financing will replace the Credit Union's loan when construction is complete.Construction lending involves an elevated level of risk; therefore, the Credit Union will closely monitor any concentration in this activity. The Credit Union seeks a broad diversification of project types, borrows and geographic areas. The Credit Union\u2019s focus will be on construction loans for market-based single family residential projects. 2. REQUIREMENTS FOR LOAN APPROVAL. Before a construction loan will be approved, the following must be procured: 1. Long-term financing upon completion of construction. Whenever possible, terms of permanent financing will provide for extensions should the construction project fail to finish on time; 2. Detailed cost estimates, building plans and copies of contracts; 3. An evaluation of the quality of the builder, including financial stability, experience and track record and copies of builder\u2019s insurance; 3. QUALIFYING BORROWERS. Qualifying borrowers are those borrowers who meet the Credit Union's credit underwriting standards.. 4. GENERAL CONTRACTOR. Members are urged to use general contractors to assist in building the home. The Credit Union should have documentation to indicate that the contractor, developer and subcontractors have demonstrated the capacity to successfully complete the project being undertaken. 5. DRAWS. Funds will be released in stages based on the percentage of the home\u2019s completion, which will be verified by on-site inspections. The Credit Union will maintain meticulous records of all draws. Whenever possible, draw checks will be made out to the subcontractor or material supplier in the form of a lien waiver check. Any evidence of cost overruns will be reported to the AVP Credit Administration / Chief Lending Officer who will in turn reassess the risk exposure and classify the loan if necessary. Before disbursing draws, the Credit Union will update the title search to ensure that title remains clear. 6. INSPECTIONS. The Credit Union will carefully monitor the progress of the construction by conducting periodic on-site inspections. Inspections will be performed by qualified individuals. Typically, the Credit Union will hire an independent general contractor to determine whether the construction of the home is on schedule with the cost breakdown. Loan officers will review these inspection reports along with county or city building inspector reports prepared in connection with building permits. If the loan officer determines a large difference in the loan value and the collateral value, the loan will be referred to the credit manager for classification. 11. LOANS FOR THE SECONDARY MARKET 1. The Credit Union may make loans that are eligible to be sold in the secondary market. The potential of selling loans provides the Credit Union with greater liquidity and thus enables the Credit Union to meet the needs of more people within our trade area, as well as added fee income for the Credit Union. 2. It will be the policy of the Credit Union to have dedicated mortgage loan originators who are educated in the secondary market guidelines and compliance and will be registered in accordance with the SAFE Act. 3. The Credit Union may apply the special options (such as FNMA (Fannie Mae) Refi Plus) similar program concessions, including loan balances beyond appraised value, and reliance on earlier warranties, only to loans previously originated by the Credit Union, and that are currently serviced by the Credit Union. 4. Any 1st lien real estate loan with an LTV greater than 80% may require a full underwrite by a mortgage insurance company employee using newly acquired verification documentation. The credit union may also have delegated underwriting authority from the mortgage insurance company and will underwrite loans for MI (Mortgage Insurance) in accordance with secondary market guidelines. 5. 1 to 4 family residential units will be underwritten by the Credit Union\u2019s 1 to 4 family Underwriter taking into consideration certain Credit Union underwriting requirements per the 1 to 4 family Underwriting Guidelines. Secondary market loans are intended to be approved eligible by the programs automated underwriter. The credit union will adhere to FHFA secondary market guidelines for all residential mortgage loans. Any file requiring a manual underwrite will be presented in full to the AVP Secondary Underwriting for review and approval. 6. The Credit Union will adhere to the GSE\u2019s quality control pre-funding and post funding requirements. The Credit Union will perform the pre-funding checklist for all 1 to 4 family real estate loans to confirm all documentation and information, data entry, and automated underwriting requirements are up to date, accurate and supportive of the credit approval before settlement documents will be prepared. The performance of the quality control activity will be evidenced within the loan origination system or by work products such as papers and checklists. A list of findings, appropriate notifications or reporting, and such documentation will be maintained in the for audit purposes. Should a post-closing finding indicate the loan is not qualified for sale, the investor will be informed within 30 days of the finding. 7. The Credit Union may use alternative documentation instead of standard full documentation to support the approval of a credit request. The Credit Union requires third party verification of all information submitted in the URLA. Documented non-traditional credit histories may substituted for credit scores as allowed by the secondary market. A tax return analysis of 2 years of history will be performed for self-employed, business owners, property investors, etc. in cases where no other form of income support can be verified and to allow adjustment from taxable income to cash flow income. 12. OTHER MORTGAGE LOAN POLICIES 1. Second Mortgages - Superior quality second mortgage loans are desirable under specific circumstances. Home improvement loans are generally secured by a mortgage, usually a second mortgage, but second mortgages may also be used as primary or additional collateral for other types of loans. Whenever such loans are granted, it is required that; 1. The real estate be appraised as per matrices listed below (subject to exceptions shown in the ACU-03-014 Appraisal Policy); 1. KBID 1869 HE Loan - UW Matrix and Guidelines 2. KBID 1871 HELOC - UW Matrix and Guidelines 3. KBID 6846 HE Plus - UW Matrix and Guidelines 2. Prior mortgage balances be determined, 3. Title Search be obtained 4. Hazard insurance policy be obtained, and 5. Any deviations from these requirements are to be approved by the Chief Lending Officer. 2. Employee Loans \\- Employees shall not receive a preferential rate. The employee will be responsible for all out-of-pocket expenses (appraisal, title search, and recording fees). All employee loans must be approved by the CLO or AVP Secondary Market or designated employees as per the Loan Authority Matrix. . Employee loans will be based on the same qualifications as any other credit worthy Member. (See the ACU-03-003 Loans to Officials and Employees for other restrictions on loans to executive officers, Directors, and principal shareholders.) 13. USE OF THIRD-PARTY BROKERS AND CORRESPONDENTS 1. Before entering into a relationship with a third-party broker or correspondent, the Credit Union will adhere to its ACU-11-011 Third Party Risk Management Policy. 14. SERVICING 1. The Credit Union will comply with the Mortgage Servicing Rule published by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) amended the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) of 1974, which is implemented by Regulation X, and the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), which is implemented by Regulation Z, with regard to the servicing of certain residential mortgage loans. 2. The Mortgage Serving Rule applies to Regulation X including: error resolution and information requests; force-placed insurance; general servicing policies, procedures, and requirements; early intervention with delinquent members; continuity of contact with delinquent members; and loss mitigation; and Regulation Z including: interest rate adjustment notices for ARMs; prompt crediting of mortgage payments and responses to requests for payoff amounts; and periodic statements for mortgage loans, which are covered in ACU-03-012 Mortgage Servicing. . 15.

For any other reason, the Credit Union must ensure that the member receives the Escrow Closing Notice no later than 30 business days before the member\u2019s escrow account is closed. 2. Content of Notice. The content of the Escrow Closing Notice will be consistent with the requirements in Regulation Z (1026.20). 16. WRITTEN AUTHORIZATION 1. Prior to sharing any member tax return information through either a sale to the secondary market, third party servicing relationship or otherwise, the Credit Union will obtain the member\u2019s written authorization. 17. RECORD RETENTION 1. Record Retention Requirements. The Credit Union will retain records that document actions with respect to a member\u2019s mortgage loan account until one year after the date the Credit Union discharges the mortgage or transfers the servicing. 18. EXCEPTIONS TO POLICY 1. This policy states the general rules for granting real estate credit. Exceptions may be made when, in the judgment of the Chief Lending Officer the loan should be approved. In such instances, the reasons and any supporting documentation must be included with the loan file and approval review package. 19. TRAINING 1. Department management will provide training on regulation, policy and procedural changes associated with all lending, servicing, and collection operations. 20. REVIEW OF POLICY 1. The Board of Directors shall review this policy at least annually, making revisions and amendments as it deems appropriate. The Chief Lending Officer will assist in such reviews and will bring specific matters requiring attention to the Board of Directors.

Pricing and terms of loans shall be determined based strictly on non- discriminatory guidelines, pursuant to the Credit Union's Fair Lending Policy. The Credit Union's objective is to set consumer loan rates based on market conditions, competition, profitability, and liquidity needs. SCOPE Consumer Lending DEFINITIONS The Credit Union offers both fixed and variable rate financing. 1. VARIABLE RATE FINANCING. Variable interest fluctuates with the prime interest rate. The spread of prime rate and interest rates charged by the Credit Union is governed by the Pricing Committee and term structure set forth by the loan management team each month. 2. FIXED RATE FINANCING. Fixed interest rates are set at levels that match the Chief Financial Officer's forecast of economic growth and management goals of (1) maintaining a healthy spread between current cost of funds and projected loan rates and (2) maintaining a competitive position in the financial marketplace. 3. RATE DETERMINATION. Interest rates for consumer loans are determined based on a risk-based pricing strategy revolving around the credit risk associated with the borrowers' credit scores, loan term, and loan-to-value and collateral age, when applicable. RESPONSIBILITIES 1. To set the interest rates that members are charged for Consumer Loans, the Board has delegated rate setting to Management. 2. Management has formed a Pricing Committee for this purpose. 1. The Committee will meet regularly, but no less than quarterly. 3. EXCEPTIONS 1. The Credit Union will allow exceptions based on the Loan Exception Policy.

The purpose of this policy is to ensure AmeriCU Credit Union is compliant with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and NCUA 717 Appendix E. SCOPE All Business Units/Departments DEFINITIONS \"Reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate\" means having specific knowledge, rather than relying solely on allegations made by a member, that would cause a reasonable person to have substantial doubts about the accuracy of the information. RESPONSIBILITY Management Responsibility - Credit Union Management (\"Management\") will be responsible for development, implementation, and maintenance of the procedures related to this policy, but may assign these responsibilities. 1. Reporting Correct and Updated Information. If at any time the Credit Union determines that the information provided is not complete or accurate, the Credit Union must promptly notify all CRAs that received the information of any corrections to that information or must provide any additional information. This is necessary to ensure the information provided is complete and accurate, and the Credit Union must not, thereafter, report any of the information that remains incomplete or inaccurate. 2. Reporting on Disputed Information. When the accuracy or completeness of any information reported to a CRA is disputed by the member, the Credit Union may not furnish the information to a CRA without notice that such information is disputed by the member. 3. Reporting the Voluntary Closure of Accounts. If the Credit Union regularly notifies the CRA of the voluntary closure of the account by the member, it shall do so using information regularly furnished for the period in which the account is closed. 4. Reporting Dates of Delinquency. If the Credit Union furnishes information to a CRA regarding a delinquent account being placed for collection, charged off to profit or loss, or subjected to any similar action, the Credit Union will provide the CRA, within 90 days after furnishing that information. The date of delinquency on the account shall be the month and year of the commencement of the delinquency that immediately preceded the delinquency action. 1. The Credit Union will establish and follow reasonable procedures to ensure that the dates reported for the date of delinquency precedes the date upon which the account was placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subjected to any similar actions. 5. Prevention of Reporting on Blocked Information - Notice of Identity Theft. The Credit Union shall have procedures in place to respond to any notification that it receives from a CRA relating to information resulting from identity theft, to prevent the Credit Union from refurnishing such blocked information. 1. If the member submits an identity theft report to the Credit Union, stating that the information they reported resulted from identity theft, the Credit Union may not furnish such information that relates to that member to any CRA, unless the Credit Union knows or is informed by the member that the information is correct. 6. Reporting Negative Information. If the Credit Union, in the ordinary course of its business, furnishes information to a CRA which contains negative information regarding credit extended to a customer, the Credit Union will provide notice in writing to the member that negative information was furnished to a CRA. The Credit Union may submit additional negative information to a CRA with respect to the same transaction, extension of credit, account or member, without providing additional notice to the member. 1. The notice will be provided either prior to reporting it to the CRA or, at least, no later than 30 days after the negative information was reported to the CRA. 2. The notice must be clear and conspicuous, and, where it is provided to the member prior to the furnishing of negative information to the CRA, the notice may not be included in the initial disclosures required under the Truth in Lending Act. 3. The notice may be included on or with any notice of default, any billing statement, or any other materials provided to the member.

In this policy we explain exceptions (overrides) and describe the different types of exceptions/overrides allowed by AmeriCU and how exception approvals are handled. SCOPE Consumer Lending Department DEFINITIONS ACH - Automated Clearing House | AVM - Automated Valuation Models ---|--- BK - Bankruptcy | CLTV - Combined Loan-to-value DI - Discretionary Income | DTI - Debt-to-income FICO - Fair Isaac Corporation | LTV - Loan-to-value MI - Mortgage Insurance | NMLA - National Mortgage Licensing System & Registry PCR - Property Condition Report | PMI - Private Mortgage Insurance QM - Qualified Mortgage | SSN - Social Security Number SVP - Senior Vice President | TDR - Troubled Debt Restructures RESPONSIBILITY 1. Overrides and Exceptions 1. An override occurs when a decision made concerning a loan application falls outside of loan policy/guidance. Overrides can be loan exceptions for: 1. Underwriting 2. Terms and conditions (such as term, pricing or rate). 1. Overrides of terms and conditions are generally considered rate exceptions and are addressed within this document. 2. Approaches to Overrides 1. Exceptions to a loan policy/guide that takes place is either (1) discretionary or (2) based on some type of compensating factor or extenuating circumstance. Discretionary overrides are decisions made that fall within a loan officer\u2019s lending authority in which there may not be any quantifiable attributes documented that influenced the decision. These types of overrides tend to be subjective, resulting in inconsistencies which can adversely impact fair lending over time. Overrides based on compensating factors tend to be less subjective, more consistent, and are generally quantifiable. AmeriCU strives for all overrides to fall into this category (compensating factors) and to avoid or keep to a minimum any discretionary overrides. 2. Another issue to be avoided is that of \u201cselective overrides\u201d; that is, \u201cgoing the distance\u201d for one member in trying to work out a loan or better terms and not doing so for another. Although not intended, this increases the risk of the appearance of discriminatory preferences. Selective overrides are strongly discouraged by AmeriCU. 3. Compensating Factors 1. By our definition, compensating factors are attributes that offset some component of credit risk identified during the loan application process. A compensating factor can offset either a positive or a negative. 2. For example, a loan that would be approved according to policy (refer to ACU-01-004 Approval/Authority Limits Policy) may be denied because it is discovered that the applicant\u2019s otherwise stable employment history is not going to continue. This is an example of a compensating factor. 3. Equally, an applicant that would be denied because of a low credit score may be approved if there are other positive factors in the application, credit file, the only derogatory on their credit report was a medical collection or relationship with the credit union. 4. AmeriCU Guidelines for Compensating Factors 1. Compensating factors should be well defined and quantifiable. 2. The fair lending regulations specifically prohibit \u201cunduly subjective standards.\u201d Financial institutions should strive to minimize subjectivity in determining compensating factors. Factors can be considered subjective when they are either not quantifiable or not well defined. 1. For example, to override a decision because an applicant is \u201ca good customer\u201d is not easily quantifiable and thus subjective. Similarly, to approve a customer for \u201cexcessive collateral\u201d is quantifiable but not well defined. If an acceptable loan-to-value was determined and then established as a compensating factor, however, it would no longer be subjective. 2. AmeriCU uses the following guide to quantify and define acceptable reasons for exceptions and compensating factors. 1. Reasons for Exceptions would be as follows: 1. Previous poor performance with us 2. Applicant below the legal age (management only) 3. Ineligible for membership 4. Unable to verify income and/or employment 5. Bankruptcy on file and/or limited credit since bankruptcy (less than 2 years of new trade line history) 6. Insufficient Discretionary Income 7. High revolving debt 8. Currently delinquent loans 9. Insufficient collateral (LTV/CLTV) 10. Does not meet product guidelines 11. High unsecured debt ratio 12. Unable to verify SSN 13. Loan Term 14. Rate Exception 2. The following compensating factors are acceptable for approval of loans: 1. Previous loans paid as agreed with institution 2. Proof derogatory credit resolved 3. Verified liquid assets/deposits (6 month average) with AmeriCU sufficient to support the requested loan amount. Assets should at least 25% of the loan amount and should be documented in the loan file. 4. Stable employment/income with the same employer or line of work, being in the same profession for 10 or more years 5. Established AmeriCU relationship of at least 5 years 6. Member has direct deposit. 7. Loan to value of less than or equal to 80% for secured consumer or mortgage loans 8. Sufficient Discretionary/Residual/ Disposable Income. 9. Either applicant has an acceptable credit score 10. BK score over 600 11. Applicant has low debt-to-income or sufficient discretionary income 3. Any one or combination of compensating factors is acceptable for an override, however, whenever possible at least two (2) factors should be identified. 4. Existing AmeriCU loan workouts or TDR or special marketing/Business Partner programs are excluded from override/exception guidelines. 5. Rate exceptions 1. A Rate Match exception for a rate up to 1% lower than the AmeriCU offer rate can be made by a Level 2 or higher underwriter if the member provides proof of a similar loan type and terms or the employee is able to document the competitor rate offer dated within the last 30 days. Examples of proof of competitor offer are: a Loan Estimate, Pre-qualification letter, or a borrower-specific offer from a local lender. We will match retail/offerings to borrowers and don't compete against dealerships with indirect financing. The rate match applicant must meet the qualifications for the loan approval and the loan file must be documented with details of the original offer that is being matched. 2. The following must also apply: Rate exceptions are not allowed for variable rate loan products. Floor rate: 1.49% for secured consumer loans, 4.99% for unsecured loans, 2.49% for mortgage and Home Equity loans. 3. Rate exceptions not associated with a Rate Match or more than 1% lower than the offered rate are to be discouraged, but may be approved for a lower rate (subject to the above floor rates) by a Level 4 or higher loan officer with requisite loan authority to approve the amount of the loan. The justification for the rate exception must be documented in the loan file. 4. Rate exceptions below the floor rate must be approved by a Chief level officer. 5. NOTES: The individual approving an interest rate exception MUST have an NMLS number for any loan rate exception involving residential real estate. Under no circumstances can a rate decision be based on a prohibited factor or in violation of ACU-03-016 Fair Lending. 6. Loan Override Authority 1. A random/sample review of loans will include a review to ensure loans are approved by individuals with requisite lending authority. 7. Unsecured Consumer Loan Override Guide 1. Credit Score Factors Based on ACU-03-002 Managed Risk Lending Policy. 8. Secured Consumer Loan Override Guide 1. Credit Score Factors Based on ACU-03-002 Managed Risk Lending Policy. 2. LTV Factors 1. If the LTV is greater than 150%, an override exception approval is required by Level 5 Underwriter (or higher underwriting level) with requisite loan authority and compensating factors documented. Mortgage Loan Override Authority 1. Mortgage loans have underwriting guidelines that are generally based on credit score, LTV, and DTI. Therefore, our mortgage override authority is designed around those factors. 2. Credit Score Factors The credit union underwrites for high quality credit indicated by credit scores and established credit history, employment history, and liquid reserves. If the credit score used is equal to or greater than 630 Vantage (or FICO score) for at least one borrower, no override is required. If the credit score used is less than 630 for both borrowers, an override is required from a mortgage underwriter. Below is guidance for making override decisions. 3. LTV Factors 1. PMI is generally required to be purchased by borrowers if the LTV for their loan is greater than 80%. Property values are generally determined by estimates of market value established by third party appraisers or the use of third-party AVM. Override guidance for LTV follows: If the LTV is less than or equal to 80%, no override is required for any factors. If the LTV is greater than 80% and the loan is protected by MI or if the loan program is one of AmeriCU\u2019s designated No MI programs, no override is required. If the LTV is greater than 90% and no MI is provided and the loan is not a No MI program, an override is required by the Underwriter. No new loan may be approved with an LTV greater than 100% unless the override/exception is approved by a Chief level. (TDR and workouts are excluded from this approval restriction.) We order an appraisal on most loan files. On occasion we will use the AVM and/or PCR when an appraiser has difficulty obtaining adequate comparison sales data. Valuations are used in conjunction with the review of the entire loan file and borrower qualifications. 4. DTI Factors The borrower's ability to pay is traditionally determined by a monthly DTI. If the loan DTI calculation is less than or equal to 45% no override is needed. However, we must follow the regulatory requirements for ability to pay and QM rules applicable for loans with a DTI greater than 40%. If the DTI is greater than 45.0% an override compensating factor is required by the Underwriter. If the DTI is greater than 50.0%, an override approval must be documented by the Manager of mortgage underwriting or a higher level (AVP or higher) \u2013 documentation by email which is copied to the loan file is sufficient. No new loan may be approved with a DTI greater than 60% unless the override/exception is approved by SVP Lending or Chief level. Liquid reserves exceeding 3 months of reserves may be used as a compensating factor for a high DTI. Home Equity Authority 1. AVM Factors AmeriCU will perform an Automated Valuation Method (AVM) to determine the property\u2019s value. With this automated method and depending on the borrowers qualifying information we may need to move to a full appraisal as applicable. Use of the High Value of the AVM requires an exception approved by the AVP of Secondary Market & Credit Administration or Level 5 lending authority when the CLTV is between 80-89.99%. 2. Credit Score Factors If either borrower has a score below 660 a second review by an AmeriCU level 4 or higher loan Authority needs to be completed and documented in the application. If either borrower has a score below 610 a second review by the AVP Secondary Market & Credit Administration or AmeriCU level 5 or higher loan Authority needs to be completed and documented in the application 3. DTI Factors If the DTI is less than or equal to 45%, no override is required If the DTI is 45.01% - 49.99% requires an override of Level 4 or higher If the DTI is greater than 50% requires an override from AVP, Secondary Market & Credit Administration or AmeriCU Level 5 or higher Fair Lending Compliance Statement 1. A managed approach is the best way to avoid issues with fair lending. Our desire and procedure is to keep discretionary overrides to a minimum, apply exceptions consistently, and utilize compensating factors that are as objective as possible. This, coupled with underwriting guidelines that are closely followed will provide a firm foundation to successfully navigate the world of fair lending. AmeriCU will also use portfolio analytical tools to monitor its loan portfolio for any disparities in loan rates that may have unintended fair lending consequences. Management will be provided Fair Lending reports on at least a quarterly basis.

For the purposes of this policy, an indirect merchant loan is any unsecured home improvement, recreational vehicle, other retail goods and product-secured loan processed through the merchant that involves three parties: the merchant, the member/borrower, and the credit union. An indirect merchant loan is originated at a merchant with which the credit union has a signed contract and may pay a fee. The credit union makes the underwriting decision and issues the adverse action notice if not approved. SCOPE All consumer lending affiliated areas of the credit union, including, but not limited to, Virtual Services, Consumer Lending, Risk and Compliance. DEFINITIONS AVG - Average AVP - Assistant Vice President DTI - Debt-to-income FTE - Full-time Employee LTV - Loan to Value ROA - Return on Asset RESPONSIBILITY It is the policy of the credit union to comply with all lending regulations and requirements set forth by both federal and state governments, NCUA, and to adhere to sound business practices. The indirect lending function of the credit union is a point-of-sale financing program. The primary goal is to be at the point of sale and capture the loans that could be lost to competitors. By having a point-of-sale program, the credit union can successfully compete with other financial institutions and captive financing sources. The credit union will work to build a strong portfolio through relationships with the various dealerships/merchants. The members of the credit union/borrowers will close the loan with the dealer/merchant, within the parameters set and controlled by the credit union. Indirect point-of-sale financing members/borrowers may receive different rates and terms available for direct loans. Merchant point-of-sale financing members/borrowers\u2019 rates and terms available may differ from direct loans. The indirect lending program was developed for the convenience of members who want to combine the purchase and financing at the point of sale. Additionally, the dealership/merchant has the ability to direct the member\u2019s/borrower\u2019s financing source to another financial institution if the credit union does not offer point-of-sale financing. The indirect merchant lending program is limited to reputable dealerships/merchants that offer both new and used products. It will be the policy of the credit union to enter into a point-of-sale program only with those dealerships/merchants that offer credit to all individuals without regard to any of the prohibited bases as specified in the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B. Any dealership/merchant suspected of having disparate lending practices will be ineligible to participate in the credit union\u2019s point-of-sale financing program. 1. Business Plan Key Areas of Focus 1. Managing Credit Risk AmeriCU will offer Indirect Merchant Partners rates and terms for Existing AmeriCU members and Potential AmeriCU members. For dealer/merchant purposes an Existing Member will be defined as an applicant having membership that has been opened prior to submission of the indirect/merchant application. Members: Minimum credit score of 650 Secured Consumer Loan Maximum Term 84 months Unsecured Consumer Loan Maximum Term 60 months Unsecured Home Improvement Loan Maximum Term 240 months Proof of income will be required for all borrowers & co-borrowers Borrower & Co-borrower must reside at the same address, or be a linear relative (spouse, parent, sibling, grandparent) LTV & DTI Defined by paper grade Overall portfolio 2.

Any school with a default rate greater than 19% will no longer be eligible for new Originations. 2. Schools with a 3 year CDR above 12% and have no historical volume with CUSC will be removed unless an exception is made. Current borrowers/members will still be allowed draws on a school no longer eligible for Loan Originations. The Cohort Default rate is defined as follows: 5. Three-year Official Cohort Default Rates for Schools 1. A 3 year cohort default rate is the percentage of a school's borrowers who enter repayment on certain FFEL Program or William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program loans during a particular federal FY, October 1 to September 30, and default or meet other specified conditions prior to the end of the next fiscal year. Please refer to the Cohort Default Rate Guide for a more in-depth description of cohort default rates and how the rates are calculated. 2. The U.S. Department of Education releases official 3-year cohort default rates once per year. The FY 2012 official 3-year cohort default rates, the most recent cohort default rates available, were delivered to both domestic and foreign schools on September 28, 2015, electronically via the eCDR process. All schools must enroll in eCDR to receive cohort default rate notification. Schools may check their eCDR enrollment online or by calling CPS/SAIG Technical Support at 800-330-5947. 3. If a school meets all criteria, it can be included on CUSC master list, located at: http://www.studentchoice.org/students/approved-schools-undergraduate/. 6. Loan Specifics: 1.

Once dispersed, all loan information is given to UAS to service the loan, including; collect payments, remitting payments to the Credit Union, and collecting on defaulted loans. 10. Asset Quality Review 1. New Loan Origination Purpose: Outline the steps that Asset Quality will take to review student loans. Ten percent (10%) of Student Loans will be reviewed on a quarterly basis (January, April, June and October) using the following resources: Campus Door/Opal: to review initial loan applications, credit reports, Adverse Action Letters Campus Door/Opal: to review loan documents including executed applications, signed LOC Agreements, W2s, paystubs, etc.) UAS Connect system: monthly statements and Trial Balance information. 2. Asset Quality will verify the following items: Proof of membership for both borrowers Signed application Initialed loan application stating borrower and/or co-borrower gainfully employed, if applicable Signed Promissory Note Notice to Cosigner Credit Report for both borrowers meet minimum Credit Score requirements Proof of income and income meets minimum income requirements Private Education Line of Credit Account Opening Disclosures Minimum loan amount of $1,000 and Maximum loan amount of $50,000 Verification that borrowers interest rate as disclosed on LOC Agreement matches borrowers interest rate as disclosed on monthly statements 3. If any items are missing and/or incorrect, our Client Relations Representative at Credit Union Student Choice will be contacted. If items are not corrected within ten (10) business days, a follow-up email and phone call will take place. If the outstanding items are still not corrected within twenty-five (25) business days, the Chief Lending Officer of Lending will be notified for further corrective action. 4. Comparison of Account Disclosure Rate and Statement rate-verification will be made that the interest rate assigned at the time of origination corresponds to loan rate as indicated on monthly statement. (10% to be reviewed semi\u2013annually i.e. January and July) 11. Annual Review 1. Borrowers approved for a line-of-credit, had a disbursement on the line-of-credit, and who are not currently in grace or are graduated, are evaluated for future credit eligibility. Both Borrower and Co-borrower credit is evaluated to ensure there is no deterioration in credit since approval. Underwriting criterion remains consistent with expectations at time of application. The credit requirements are as follows: No record of paid or unpaid charge-off, collection, or settled account, for an amount over $500 w/in past two (2) years No record of repossession, judgment, suit, or tax lien, for an amount over $2,500 w/in past two (2) years No record of a foreclosure or bankruptcy (discharged/not yet discharged) w/in past five (5) years No record of student loan default No credit lines currently 60 days past due For loans with a Co-borrower, Co-borrower's Credit Score must be 680 or greater The Borrower's Credit on a Co-signed loan is not considered in the review, providing there were no other derogatory items. Campus Door agrees to utilize the Co-borrowers Credit as the primary credit score. For loans w/o a Co-borrower, the borrower's Credit Score must be 680 or greater All Borrowers who do not meet the above requirements will have their line-of-credit suspended and an Adverse Action Letter will be mailed. 12. On an annual Basis, AmeriCU will review and evaluate the profitability of the student lending program. If it is determined to exit the student lending business, AmeriCU will continue to have a third party service its existing portfolio or sell the entire portfolio servicing released.

This Act requires that the interest rate on loans incurred before military personnel began active duty be reduced to 6% for the duration of the active duty. It also affords additional protections to such personnel. The Credit Union will also comply with the Department of Defense\u2019s Military Lending Act (MLA) and the NCUA Letter to Federally Insured Credit Unions (12-CU-07) \u201cMortgage Servicing Practices Impacting Military Homeowners\u201d which provides additional protections for the loans outlined herein. Additionally, the Credit Union will comply with The Laws of New York State \u201cNew York State Soldiers\u2019 and Sailors\u2019 Civil Relief Act\u2019, that may cover a particular member. SCOPE Lending, Risk Management, Operations, all member-facing staff. DEFINITIONS EFT - Electronic Funds Transfer | HUD - Housing and Urban Development | ITIN - Individual Taxpayer Identification Number ---|---|--- MAPR - Military Annual Percentage Rate | MLA - Military Lending Act | NCUA - National Credit Union Association PCS - Permanent Change of Station | ROTC - Reserve Officers' Training Corps | SCRA - Servicemembers Civil Relief Act RESPONSIBILITY 1. Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) 1. Persons Protected 1. Primary Coverage. The Act protects persons on active duty in the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, Space Force, Coast Guard, commissioned corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and commissioned corps of the Public Health Service. This includes reserve units that are called to active duty. National Guard members are covered when called to active service authorized by the President or the Secretary of Defense for a period longer than 30 days. \"Active duty\" can occur during peacetime, including active duty training (boot camp), training and education programs (ROTC), or a reserve component call-up (such as Operation Desert Shield in 1990-91). Typically, protections begin for: 1. Servicemembers who are on active duty full-time status; the date on which the servicemember is called to military service. 2. Reservist or National Guards who are not full-time; the date orders are received through the date of reporting for military service and beyond while on active duty military status. 3. Persons ordered to report for induction to military service; the date orders are received through the date of reporting for military service and beyond while on active military status. 2. Special Coverage. In certain situations, protection extends to: 1. Persons who are financially dependent on the servicemember, defined as the servicemember\u2019s spouse, child, or an individual for whom the servicemember provided more than one half of the individual\u2019s support for 180 days immediately preceding an application for SCRA relief. 2. Cosigners, guarantors, or endorsers of debts incurred by the servicemember. 2. Debts Covered. The SCRA applies to debts incurred by the servicemember before they entered into active duty. Thus, credit card charges made after active duty began are not subject to the protections of the Act. 3. Interest Rate Reduction To 6%. 1. On any covered debt incurred prior to active duty, the Credit Union must reduce the interest rate to 6% during the period of active duty. 1. The servicemember must provide the Credit Union with a written notice and military orders calling him/her to active duty, as well as any orders further extending military service. In lieu of notice and documentation from the servicemember, the Credit Union may independently verify military status through the Defense Manpower Data Center prior to reducing the interest rate on applicable loans. The Credit Union is provided with a safe harbor if relying on information retrieved from the Defense Manpower Data Center indicates the servicemember is not on active duty and the Credit Union (by the end of the 180- day period) has not received written notice and documentation from the servicemember. 2. The rate reduction takes effect when active duty began, not when the Credit Union receives notice of the active duty. 3. \"Interest\" includes all service charges, renewal charges, fees or any other charges (except bona fide insurance). 4. The Credit Union must reduce the amount of the payment on outstanding balances and cannot reduce the number of total payments to be made. 2. Under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA), the 6% rate reduction for all obligations and liabilities consisting of a mortgage, deed of trust or other security in the nature of a mortgage, incurred during the period of active military service is to be extended until one year after active duty status. 3. The Credit Union must forgive any interest in excess of 6% that would have been incurred if no rate cap was in effect. 4. The 6% limit does not apply to new advances under an existing credit card or home equity line of credit program. 5. The Credit Union cannot automatically refuse to lower the rate. In order to challenge the rate reduction, the Credit Union can petition an appropriate court to authorize a higher interest rate. The Credit Union must show that the servicemember's ability to repay the loan is \"not materially affected\" by the active duty service. 6. The Credit Union may reinstate the original contract rate on non-mortgage loan debt outstanding balances as soon as the servicemember is no longer on active duty. 7. The Credit Union may reinstate the original contract rate on mortgage loan debt outstanding balances one year following the end of active duty service to the military. Unless there is a joint obligation with the servicemember, dependents are generally not entitled to receive reduced rates of interest on loans, but may seek court protection to prevent foreclosure, repossession or an out of court sale. 4. Renegotiation of Loan Contracts. Rather than collect the 6%, the Credit Union and the servicemember may choose to renegotiate the original loan contract. Under the SCRA, contracts may be modified, terminated or canceled, and that property which is security for an obligation may be repossessed, foreclosed, sold or forfeited pursuant to a written agreement between the servicemember and the Credit Union that is entered into during or after the period of active duty. All decisions to renegotiate contracts shall be made by management. 5. Truth-In-Lending Issues. 1. Open-End Loans. For open-end loans, a change-in-terms notice is required when the Credit Union reinstates the contractual rate. This notice may be sent when the Credit Union receives notice of active duty. 2. Closed-End Loans. For closed-end loans, an additional disclosure is only required for variable-rate loans secured by a member\u2019s principal dwelling that have a term of greater than one year. This notice must be sent at least 25 days and no more than 120 calendar days prior to the date that a payment at the new level is due, and includes the following information: 1. The current and prior interest rates; 2. The index values upon which the current and prior rates are based; 3. The extent to which the Credit Union has foregone an increase in the interest rate; 4. The contractual effects of the adjustment, including the payment due after the adjustment and a statement of the loan balance; and 5. The payment, if different from the disclosure in 1.E.ii. 4 (above) that would be required to fully amortize the loan at the new interest rate over the remainder of the loan term. 6. Suspension of Payments and Extension of Loan. A servicemember may request a court to suspend loan payments that fall due during active duty. If the servicemember is being sued for repayment of an obligation, the court may authorize reduced or suspended payments. 1. If such payments are suspended, the servicemember must begin making payments when active duty ends over an extended period of time authorized by the court. The maximum extension that may be authorized depends on the type of security. 1. Loans Secured by Real Estate. The maximum extension is the remaining term of the loan plus the period of active duty service. 2. Loans Secured by Personal Property. The maximum extension is no longer than the period of active duty service. 3. Loan payments that fall due after active duty terminates must be paid on time. 7. Restriction on Default Judgments. In order to obtain a default judgment, the Credit Union must provide an affidavit stating facts showing that the defendant is not in military service. If the statement is not filed, the judgment is voidable (i.e., can be set aside and reopened by the servicemember upon proper showing that he/she has been prejudiced because of military service in making a defense.) 8. Reopening Default Judgments. A servicemember may have a default judgment reopened if the judgment was entered during service or within 60 days after separation from service. The servicemember must apply to the same court that entered the judgment and must file within 90 days after his or her military service ends. 1. Setting aside a default judgment will not impair the rights or title to property that has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser. Thus, if a car is properly repossessed and resold to a bona fide purchaser, the defendant would not be able to reclaim the car, but could seek money damages from the Credit Union. 9. Prohibition of Foreclosures and Repossessions. For covered debts secured by a servicemember's real or personal property, the Credit Union cannot foreclose on or repossess the security unless the Credit Union has first obtained prior authorization from a court, unless the servicemember and Credit Union entered into a loan agreement or modification after the member\u2019s active duty service that allows the Credit Union to foreclose on the loan and repossess the property. 1. Default Notification. Pursuant to Section 688 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006, the Credit Union will provide homeownership counseling notification (prepared by the Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] to all members in default regarding the foreclosure rights of servicemembers and their dependents under the SCRA. The notice must: 1. Be sent to all homeowners who are in default on a residential mortgage (HUD\u2019s counseling notification requirement only applies to a loan that is secured by the principal residence of the homeowner); 2. Include the toll-free military one-source number to call if servicemembers or their dependents require further assistance (1-800-342-9647); and 3. Be made within 45 days from the date of a missed payment was due, unless the homeowner pays the overdue amount before the expiration of the 45-day period. 2. In order to initiate a foreclosure under HERA, the Credit Union must wait twelve (12) months after a servicemember returns from active duty service. 10. Stay of Legal Proceedings. During service or within 90 days of separation, the servicemember can request a stay of any legal proceeding including enforcement of a judgment (e.g., execution, garnishment), or the court may enter a stay on its own motion. The court shall grant the stay unless the servicemember's active duty does not materially affect his or her ability to defend the proceeding. If the proceeding is stayed, the Credit Union cannot assess any fines or penalties against the servicemember while the stay is in effect. This protection applies to all of a servicemember's debts, including those incurred during active duty. 1. The fact that a servicemember applies for or is granted temporary relief from his/her obligations and liabilities pursuant to the SCRA may not in and of itself be the basis for any of the following by the Credit Union: 1. A determination that the servicemember is unable to pay the obligation or liability A denial or revocation of credit, change in the terms of an existing credit arrangement, or refusal to grant credit in substantially the same amount or on substantially the same terms requested. 2. An adverse report related to the creditworthiness of the servicemember by or to a credit bureau. 3. A note in the servicemember\u2019s record identifying him/her as a member of the National Guard or a Reserve component. 4. A refusal to insure the servicemember; or 5. A change in terms offered or conditions required for the issuance of insurance. 11. New York State Soldiers\u2019 and Sailors\u2019 Civil Relief Act section 312 No sale, foreclosure, or seizure of property for nonpayment of any sum due under any such obligation, or for any other breach of the terms thereof, whether under a power of sale, under a judgment entered upon warrant of attorney to confess judgment contained therein, or otherwise, shall be valid if made during the period of military service, or within six months thereafter, unless upon an order of sale previously granted by the court and a return thereto made and approved by the court. 12. Statute of Limitations. The time period in which a claim must be made is suspended during the period of military service, even if a claim arose prior to or during active duty service. 13. Eviction and Distress. When the Credit Union becomes the owner of residential property that is rented to a servicemember, the Credit Union may not evict a servicemember or his/her dependents unless a court order is obtained. Additionally, the Credit Union may not subject the premises to \u201cdistress\u201d (seizure of property to secure payment of overdue rent) during the period of military service. 14. Termination of Leases. The SCRA permits servicemembers to terminate a \u201ccovered lease\u201d if he/she delivers written notice of termination, along with a copy of his/her military orders to the Credit Union or its agent. This notice must be delivered by hand, private business carrier, or U.S. Mail, posted prepaid, return receipt requested. 1. Real Property Leases. A \u201ccovered lease\u201d of real property is a lease of premises occupied, or intended to be occupied, by a servicemember or his/her dependents for a\u201cresidential, professional, business, agricultural or similar purpose\u201d and either (1) is executed by or on behalf of a person who thereafter and during the term of the lease enters military service; or (2) is executed by a servicemember while in military service who thereafter receives military orders for a permanent change of station or to deploy with a military unit for a period of at least 90 days. For residential leases that provide for monthly rent payments, once the notice is delivered, the termination is effective 30 days after the next rental due date. 2. Motor Vehicle Leases. A \u201ccovered lease\u201d is a lease of a motor vehicle used, or intended to be used, by a servicemember or his/her dependents for personal or business transportation if (1) the lease is executed by or on behalf of a person who thereafter and during the term of the lease enters military service under a call or order specifying a period of not less than 180 days (or who enters service under such a call and, without a break in service, receives orders extending the period of military service to a period of not less than 180 days); or (2) the servicemember, while in military service, executes the lease and later receives military orders for a permanent change of station or to deploy with a military unit for a period of not less than 180 days under its terms; Along with the termination notice, the servicemember must return the vehicle to the Credit Union no later than 15 days after the date of the delivery of the written notice. 3. Termination is effective once the notice requirement and return of the vehicle are satisfied Early termination fees are prohibited, but any taxes, summonses, title and registration fees or other lessee obligations, including reasonable charges for excessive wear and tear, use and mileage, etc. that are due and unpaid at the time of termination may be charged. 15. Installment Contracts. If a servicemember has paid a deposit or installment of the purchase price prior to military service, the Credit Union may not, without a court order, exercise a right or option to terminate the contract or repossess the property for nonpayment that occurs prior to or during military service. 16. Protection of Dependents, Cosigners, Guarantors, and Endorsers. If a legal proceeding is stayed, the court may extend the stay to any dependent, cosigner, guarantor, or endorser of the servicemember's debt. 2. MILITARY LENDING ACT (MLA) 1. Loans Covered. The Credit Union will follow the Military Lending Act when granting \u201cConsumer credit\u201d to servicemembers and their dependents. \"Consumer credit\" means credit offered or extended to a covered borrower primarily for personal, family, or household purposes and that is (1) subject to a finance charge; or (2) payable by a written agreement in more than four installments. 1. Exceptions. \"Consumer credit\" does not mean: 1. A residential mortgage, which includes any credit transaction secured by an interest in a dwelling, including a transaction to finance the purchase or initial construction of the dwelling, any refinance transactions, home equity line of credit, or reverse mortgage; 2. Any credit transaction that is intended to finance the purchase of personal property when the credit is secured by the property being purchased; 3. Any credit transaction that is considered \u201cexempt\u201d under Regulation Z (other than a transaction exempt under 1026.29) or otherwise is not subject to disclosure requirements under Regulation Z; and 4. Any credit transaction or account for credit which the Credit Union determines that a consumer is not a covered borrower by using a method and comply with the recordkeeping requirements. 2. Covered Borrowers. 1. A \u201ccovered borrower\u201d is defined as a person with the following status at the time he/she becomes obligated on a consumer credit transaction: 1. _Covered Member_ \\- A member of the armed forces who is serving on active duty pursuant to title 10, title 14, or title 32 of the United States Code under a call or order that does not specify a period of 30 days or less, or such a member serving on Active Guard and Reserve duty [as defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(d)(6)]; or 2. A \u201cdependent\u201d with respect to the covered member as described in subparagraph (A), (D), (E), or (I) of 10 U.S.C. 1072(2). 2. A covered borrower does not mean a consumer who (though they were a covered borrower at the time they became obligated on a consumer credit transaction or established an account for consumer credit) is no longer a covered member or dependent of a covered member. 3. The Credit Union may apply their own method to assess whether a consumer is a covered borrower. The Credit Union is provided a safe harbor and may conclusively determine whether credit is offered or extended to a covered borrower, by assessing the status using the following methods: 1. The Credit Union may verify the status of a consumer by using information related to that consumer in a database maintained by the Department of Defense. The Credit Union will need the consumer\u2019s last name, date of birth and social security number or an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) to perform the search. Historical lookbacks in this database by the Credit Union to ascertain whether the consumer was a covered borrower after a contract has been established is prohibited. 2. The Credit Union may also verify the status of a consumer by using a statement, code, or similar indicator describing the status (if any) contained in a consumer report obtained from the consumer reporting agency. 3. Recordkeeping. The Credit Union making a determination regarding the status of a consumer by using one of the methods described above must timely create and maintain a record of the information obtained. The Credit Union may make the determination of covered status solely at the time consumer initiates the transaction or applies to establish the account or 30 days prior to that time, or at the time the Credit Union develops or processes a firm offer of credit that includes the status of the consumer as a covered borrower, so long as the consumer responds to that offer not later than 60 days after the time that the Credit Union had provided that offer to the consumer. If the consumer responds to the Credit Union\u2019s offer 60 days after the time the Credit Union provided it to the consumer, the Credit Union may act as though the consumer is initiating a new transaction. 4. Military Annual Percentage Rate (MAPR) Limitation. The MAPR, defined as \u201cthe cost of consumer credit transactions expressed as an annual rate,\u201d and includes the following: 1. Finance charges (as defined in Regulation Z) associated with the consumer credit; 2. Any application fee charged to a covered borrower who applies for consumer credit, other than an application fee charged by the Credit Union when making a short-term, small amount loan, provided that the application fee is charged not more than once in any rolling 12 month period; 3. Participation fees for a plan or arrangement for consumer credit; 4. Credit insurance premiums or fees, including charges for single premium credit insurance; 5. Fees for debt cancellation or debt suspension agreements; and 6. Fees for credit-related ancillary products sold in connection with the credit transaction for closed-end credit or an account for open-end credit. 7. Even if the above mentioned charges would be excluded from the finance charge calculation under Regulation Z, they shall still be included in the MAPR calculation. 8. The MAPR may not exceed 36%. 5. Military Annual Percentage Rate (MAPR) Calculation for Credit Cards. For credit card accounts (not home secured), a bona fide, reasonable fee, other than a periodic rate is not required to be included in the MAPR. 1. The exclusion of certain fees only applies to those fees that are bona fide and reasonable for that particular type of fee. In determining whether a bona fide fee is reasonable, the Credit Union will rely upon the safe harbor method defined within the MLA. 2. The exclusion for bona fide fees does not apply to the fees below and they must be included in the MAPR calculation: 1. Credit insurance premiums or fees; or 2. Fees for credit-related ancillary products sold in connection with the credit transaction. 6. Mandatory Disclosures. The Credit Union must provide covered borrowers with a clear and conspicuous written disclosure in a form the member can keep. 1. The disclosures (except for the Regulation Z disclosures) must be provided verbally before or at the time of consummation of the loan. For mail or internet transactions, the Credit Union complies with this requirement by providing a toll-free telephone number on or with the written disclosures that consumers may use to obtain the verbal disclosures, and the Credit Union provides the verbal disclosures to the covered borrowers upon request. 2. The written disclosures must be provided before consummation of the transaction. Disclosure of the MAPR in advertisements is not required. 3. The refinancing or renewal of a covered loan requires new disclosures only when the transaction would be considered a new transaction that requires Regulation Z disclosures. 4. The disclosures must include the following information: 1. A statement of the MAPR applicable to the extension of consumer credit, which can be satisfied with the following model language: \u201cFederal law provides important protections to members of the Armed Forces and their dependents relating to extension of consumer credit. In general, the cost of consumer credit to a member of the Armed Forces and his or her dependent may not exceed an annual percentage rate of 36 percent. This rate must include, as applicable to the credit transaction or account: The costs associated with credit insurance premiums; fees for ancillary products sold in connection with the credit transaction; any application fee charged (other than certain application fees for specified credit transactions or accounts); and any participation fee charged (other than certain participation fees for a credit card account).\u201d 2. Any disclosures required by Regulation Z (which shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of Regulation Z that apply to that disclosure); and; 3. A clear description of the payment obligation of the covered borrower, as applicable (i.e., payment statement or account-opening disclosure pursuant to Regulation Z). 7. Preemption. This regulation would preempt any inconsistent State or Federal law, rule or regulation, including any State usury law, unless such a law, rule or regulation provides additional protection to covered borrowers. States may not charge MAPRs that are higher than the limit for residents of the State, or permit the violation or waiver of any State consumer lending protection that is for the benefit of the residents of that State, solely on the basis of the covered borrower\u2019s non-resident or military status. 8. Limitations. The rule prohibits the Credit Union and its assignees from the following activities: 1. Requiring covered borrowers to waive their legal recourse under any applicable State of Federal law, including any provision of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. 2. Requiring covered borrowers to submit to arbitration or imposing other onerous legal notice provisions if the event of a dispute. 3. Demanding unreasonable legal notice as a condition for legal action. 4. Using a check or other method of access to a deposit, savings, or other financial account maintained by the member. However, creditors may do the following: 1. Require an EFT to repay the debt, unless otherwise prohibited by Regulation E; 2. Require direct deposit of the covered borrower\u2019s salary as a condition of eligibility for credit, unless otherwise prohibited by law; or 3. Take a security interest in the funds that are deposited after the extension of credit in an account established in connection with the transaction. 5. Requiring that the covered borrower establish an allotment to repay the obligation. 6. Prohibiting the covered borrower from prepaying the debt, or charging a fee for prepaying all or part of the debt. 3. MORTGAGE SERVICING PRACTICES FOR MILITARY MEMBERS WITH PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION (PCS) ORDERS 1. Persons Protected. 1. Primary Coverage. The NCUA Letter to Credit Unions 12-CU-07 applies to military servicemembers who have received mortgage services from the Credit Union and have received PCS orders from the military. 1. Mortgage services include managing a member\u2019s loan account and collecting and crediting monthly payments. 2. PCS orders require servicemembers to move to anew duty station, are non-negotiable, and operate under short, strict timelines. 2. Loans Covered. The Credit Union will follow the guidance of NCUA Letter to Credit Unions 12-CU-07 for all mortgage loans and mortgage services provided to military servicemembers. 3. Servicing Assistance. The Credit Union will protect military homeowners with PCS orders by: 1. Providing homeowners with accurate, clear, and readily understandable information about available assistance options they may qualify for, based on information known to the Credit Union. 2. Provide a reasonable means for members to obtain information on the status for their request for assistance. 3. Communicating the Credit Unions decisions on requesting assistance in a timely manner. 4. The Credit Union will NOT ask a servicemember to waive their rights under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act as a prerequisite to providing information about available assistance options or eligibility for assistance. 5. The Credit Union will NOT advise servicemembers who are current on their loans and able to make monthly payments to skip payments creating the appearance of financial distress in order to qualify for assistance. 4. Training. The Credit Union will provide training to employees in the capacity to assist servicemembers with mortgage servicing issues covering assistance programs and options available to military servicemembers. 1.

The success of the policy is the responsibility of the entire organization, however, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Lending Officer (CLO) are ultimately responsible for the implementation of this policy at the direction of the Board of Directors (\u201cBOD\u201d.) This policy applies across all aspects of consumer lending operations, including advertising and marketing, loan origination, processing, underwriting, servicing, collection, and loss mitigation activities. AmeriCU is committed to serving the credit needs of our entire field of membership, both existing members and potential members. The Credit Union's Lending Policy is a statement of the loan products/services we offer, and the terms, conditions and limitations for the products and services approved by our Board of Directors. No policy is all inclusive, but if employees follow the policies and procedures approved by AmeriCU, lending functions will be handled consistently throughout the Credit Union. If these guidelines do not fit a particular situation, Credit Union employees should immediately discuss the circumstances with either their supervisor or an Underwriter. If an exception to policy is needed, this policy contains guidance for exception approval. This guidance is not to be a substitute for good judgment in the loan officer's decision-making process. In addition, the Credit Union will participate in pre-approval or pre-screen campaigns where members will be pre-approved for certain loan products without undergoing a full underwrite by AmeriCU. The campaigns will be reviewed and approved by Management in advance of each campaign launch by Marketing and a record of each campaign credit qualifying criteria will be retained by Marketing and/or Lending. SCOPE This policy extends to our lending practices in all aspects of our business. DEFINITIONS Trade Area - The Credit Union's primary lending area comprises Central New York. While this represents the areas where the Credit Union's market share is most concentrated, the Credit Union will not restrict its lending activities to members who reside in these areas. The Credit Union will attempt to satisfactorily serve all individuals who are interested in pursuing deposit, lending, or other types of accounts or services regardless of their location as long as they are eligible for AmeriCU membership as outlined in AmeriCU bylaws. The Credit Union will consider loans to such individuals if deemed to be legal, appropriate and justified. Co-borrower (co-maker): This individual\u2019s income is added to (commingled with) the applicants income in order to meet the income requirements of the loan. The total income of both individuals is used to qualify for the loan. Co- borrowers have to \"share the benefits\" of the proceeds (loan). A co-borrower is jointly and equally liable for repayment of the loan. A co- borrower must be a member of the credit union. (The co-borrower does not need to be joint on shares within the loan account as long as they are prime member on own account.) Co-signer (guarantor): While the credit score of this individual will be considered in meeting the credit history requirements of the loan, their income is not added with the applicant\u2019s income. Loan rate is _not_ based on Co-signer's score. Both the primary borrower and the co- signer have to individually qualify for the income requirements of the loan. The guarantor does not \u201cshare the benefits\u201d of the proceeds (loan). If the primary borrower is unable to meet the loan obligations, then the co- signer is responsible for making payments on the loan. A cosigner (guarantor) does not have to be a member of the credit union. Collateral Owner (pledge of property): When an individual is not on a loan and their property is used as collateral they are placed on the loan as a Collateral Owner. They are not on the loan, and are not entitled to any loan information without property authority from the member or a POA. A Non Signer Form can be used in this situation. A Collateral Owner does not have to be a member of AmeriCU.

Lending Authority and Responsibility 1. For Consumer Lending Authorities, please reference ACU-01-004 Approval/Authority Limits Policy. 2. The lending staff will work closely with management in carrying out their duties and responsibilities. 1. The lending staffs\u2019 primary responsibilities are as follows: Process, approve or deny loan requests or provide appropriate counteroffers, and provide appropriate notice of adverse action when required. No individual is permitted to originate, process, approve, and fund a loan \u2013 there is separation of duties in the process. AmeriCU generally chooses to have centralized underwriting to ensure the separation of duties. The automated underwriting system is considered a centralized underwriter, thus provides the necessary separation. Prior to approving loans, conduct creditworthiness analysis required per the Credit Union's Lending Guidelines and procedures for borrowers not meeting our automated or instant approval criteria. Verify collateral value, credit report, income, and liabilities as directed in procedures. Ensure all loan documents are properly authorized, signed and filed. Ensure that mortgages; deeds of trust; UCC, titles and such other forms as may be required to perfect a security interest in collateral pledged to secure a loan are properly filed. Ensure repayment terms, rates, and schedules are within Policy and Regulatory limits prior to funding the loan. Assist Loan Workout & Recovery as needed to mitigate loan losses. Comply with all policies and procedures, the Credit Union's Bylaws and all requirements of state and federal law, including Fair Lending requirements. Attend all training programs required by the Credit Union and complete all training assignments by the due date to ensure they remain up to date on products, procedures, policies, and regulations. 2. Portfolio Management and Concentrations 1. A diversified loan portfolio contributes to reducing risk in the overall loan portfolio. The specific loan portfolio mix is subject to change based on loan demand, seasonality, and various economic factors. AmeriCU's specific loan portfolio mix is determined by the ALCO and is documented in our Concentration Risk Policy. The Credit Union's portfolio mixture and loan-to-deposit ratio targets are monitored by the Board via ALCO and will meet applicable legal/regulatory standards. 3. Authorized Loans, Terms and Interest Rates 1. The Board authorizes the Credit Union to make the following CONSUMER loan types covered by this Policy: 1. Credit Cards. 2. Unsecured Consumer loans, including lines of credit (loans where AmeriCU takes no collateral). 3. Consumer loans secured by shares. Certificates of Deposit and shares may be pledged as collateral in whole or in part. Loans can be issued up to 100% of collected funds in the account. Accounts that aren't eligible for collateral are share drafts, escrow, IRA's, HSA's and any share account securing a VISA credit card. Any account with a variable rate feature or interest adjustment capability is also ineligible. The loan repayment can't exceed the maturity date of the Certificate of Deposit being used as collateral. 4. Consumer loans that are titled goods (cars, boats, etc.) or UCC liens against personal property (solar panels, equipment, fixtures and other non-titled personal property) 5. Home Equity loans [including lines of credit] 2. Maximum terms and/or payment periods may be the longest time allowed pursuant to applicable New York laws and NCUA regulations. Current maximum terms are 180 months for a traditional consumer loan, 240 months for a Home Improvement or Second Mortgage loan (including collateral that qualifies as a \u201cresidence\u201d such as a houseboat.) However, prudent judgment should always be applied to ensure loans are repaid in a reasonable amount of time for the amount of loan approved, the credit risk and/or the collateral used to secure the loan. 3. Installment loans shall be repaid in substantially equal installment amounts (monthly), which shall include principal and interest. Loans secured by a Certificate of Deposit pledge require monthly interest payment with payment of principal coinciding with the maturity of the Certificate of Deposit. 4. The credit union may engage in lending through car dealerships, merchants, or through loan participation programs to supplement its direct to member lending efforts in its attempts to meet overall financial objectives. Portfolio loans will be monitored by Management to ensure the overall credit performance meets the credit unions objectives when considering the return (loan yield) for the credit risk. These loans will also be reflected in the credit union\u2019s concentration risk monitoring. 5. Rates will be established and constantly monitored to provide an adequate spread when considering costs or risks such as: the cost of funds, overhead, reserve requirements, origination costs/expenses, administrative costs/expenses, default/charge-off risk, collateral risk and collection costs plus a reasonable level of positive earnings. The Credit Union shall also consider competitiveness in the marketplace, loan demand, business objectives and the effects of long-term fixed-rate lending in determining product rates. Please see ACU-03-001 Consumer Loan Rate Pricing Policy for further details. 6. The Board delegates to Management the authority to revise the Credit Union's interest rates and fees as necessary to maintain a competitive offering. Variable or adjustable rate lines of credit or loans tied to an Index, such as Prime Rate, and Mortgage loans where rates are driven by daily market and investor pricing are not subject to Management approval but will be adjusted as the Index or market rates change. The Pricing Committee (Pricing) will be notified of fixed rate consumer loan changes and provided with a rate sheet at its regularly scheduled meetings. Loan rates may not exceed the maximum amount set forth by the New York State Rules and Regulations for a State Chartered Credit Union. 7. Personal Property Valuations 1. The Credit Union may require a third party valuation of any consumer collateral if its market value is not easily determined. Generally, auto, boat and RV valuations are determined using the MSRP for new collateral or clean retail value from an industry recognized service, such as JD Power or KBB for used collateral. Refer to ACU-03-014 Appraisal Policy for further details for real estate property valuations. 8. Risk-Based Lending/Credit Pricing 1. The Board has approved a risk-based program for the pricing of the interest rates the Credit Union offers on certain loan products. This is reflected in the ACU-03-002 Managed Risk Lending Policy which sets forth the loan products for which risk-based pricing applies. Any loan product not risk based priced is subject to the traditional interest rate policy described above. Risk-based interest rates are derived after careful consideration of the credit risk information from the Credit Union's loan portfolio and industry data, together with traditional and other factors that are relied upon to ensure the safety and soundness of the Credit Union. The Board also delegates the authority to Management to revise the risk-based rates offered. Pricing/ALCO will report any adjustments to the Board as needed or requested. Please see ACU-03-002 Managed Risk Lending Policy or further details. 9. Rate Exceptions for Individual Loans 1. The Credit Union realizes that it is unrealistic to expect our everyday rates to beat every possible rate our loan competition may offer to a member or potential member, so the Credit Union provides for rate exceptions to win or retain member loans. Management has written Rate Exception Procedures to provide staff guidance for making rate exceptions. Please see ACU-03-013 Loan Exception Policy for further details 10. High Risk Loans 1. A High-Risk Loan is defined as a loan that is extended to a borrower who is considered a High-Risk Borrower. A High-Risk Borrower is a loan applicant who has a low credit score and/or poor credit history which means they have a higher probability of defaulting. A loan with more than one borrower where they are both receiving benefit from the loan proceeds and one of those borrowers does not meet the definition of High Risk Borrower, should not be considered a High Risk Loan. The first time car buyer product offering is exempt to the high risk borrower criteria as they have their own criteria to be eligible for the product offering. 2. AmeriCU Credit Union defines a High-Risk Borrower as a borrower who: 1. Has a credit score of 620 or lower (excluding 0 scores) and any one of the following attributes. 2. Has escalating debt 3. Has in excess of 6 inquires in the previous 6 months 4. Total balances on recently reported open revolving accounts is too high 5. Total balances on recently reported open installment accounts is too high 3. In order to mitigate the risk of lending on a High-Risk loan the following process has been put into place: 1. Any consumer loan application (Credit Card, Personal Loan, and Vehicle Loan) that meets the definition of a High Risk Loan is required to be reviewed by a Level 3 or higher Underwriter for loan approval. If DTI criteria is not met, application would need to go to a Level 4 Officer for review. The following items must be true to approve a high-risk loan: 1. Max DTI allowed of 45% or approval required of Level 4 or Higher Underwriter 2. Minimum of 2 years from a prior discharged bankruptcy with new trades established of at least 2. 3. All income must be verified. 4. All derogatory items within 2 years need explanation from the borrower added to the internal comments of the file. If paid delinquencies are not reflected in the credit report, proof of paid delinquencies must be uploaded to the loan file. 5. Minimum employment length of 24 months 6. High-Risk note template required to be used when entering approval notes in application 4. Loans to Employees and Officials 1. The Credit Union must mitigate the risk of preferential treatment for loan requests made by Credit Union Officials and employees and their immediate family members. NCUA provides guidance in Part 701 used to assist in developing our ACU-03-003 Loans to Officials and Employees policy. Employees must be eligible for the new loan requested [they may not be on an active action plan for performance issues]. No employee should be involved in the lending process or transactions involving their own accounts or those of a family member. Employees and Officials should submit applications via the online application process for all loan types where online applications are available. 5. Prohibited Loans 1. The following types of loans are prohibited by policy and will not be approved under any circumstances: 1. Loans secured by restricted stock 2. Loans secured by property held in trust for a minor or incompetent person 3. Loans to people whose honesty is questionable 4. Loans for purposes that may not be legal 5. Loans to employees or officials when they are not consistent with Regulations and this policy 6. Loans for the purpose of enabling the borrower to speculate in the futures market for either securities or commodities 7. Loans secured by household goods, jewelry, or works of art 8. Loans to an individual secured by commercial/business property or for business purposes - except as allowed by our ACU-03-007 Commercial Loan Policy. 2. The Credit Union considers loans of the following type undesirable and will normally decline these loans. Exceptions for these types of loans may be approved only by one of the following employees: Level 5 or Chief Level employees with Lending Authority. 1. \"Accommodation loans\" to members with poor credit, based on the strength of a good endorser/cosigner. It is urged that, if the loan cannot be justified on its own merits, the loan should be made with a very strong cosigner with full disclosure to the cosigner regarding their responsibilities to repay the loan. 1. AmeriCU loan workouts or TDR loans are allowed even if the borrower would not otherwise qualify for the loan, such requests must be approved by the Loan Workout & Recovery employees authorized by the Chief Lending Officer . 2. Loans secured by collateral if the prospects of repayment are poor and liquidation of collateral is the primary source of repayment. Generally, these loans would only be justified for workouts to prevent or minimize large losses to the Credit Union on existing loans. Such loans should be classified as TDR loans. 2. Speculative loans not secured by readily marketable collateral. 3. Loans to borrowers who have previously caused the Credit Union a loss - including a loss for NSF or overdraft items. However, the Credit Union may not decline an application solely because a member/applicant caused us a loss due to a bankruptcy. The very rare situation where a member may have perfect credit other than the bankruptcy and still meet all the Credit Union's criteria would be given consideration. Any non-bankruptcy loss must be repaid or a repayment plan in effect before lending \"new money\" to the member. Credit unions are not permitted to require repayment of discharged debts. 4. Loans to minors (loans granted to individuals less than 18 years of age) - these are prohibited and require approval from a Level 5 or higher. 6. Asset Quality 1. The Credit Union realizes that consumers/members need access to unsecured loans, credit cards and lines of credit in addition to the historically lower risk collateralized loans. Setting portfolio limits and targets and monitoring the performance of the entire loan portfolio permits the Credit Union to better analyze our exposure to risks. This allows us to be more cognizant of negative trends in the portfolio and be proactive in addressing potential problems, thus reducing losses. 2. The Credit Union will utilize automated and human underwriting to assess the credit risk of applicants. The automated underwriting rules will be used to provide faster approvals to those members that are deemed to have low credit risk, i.e. based on credit analysis the borrower\u2019s estimated risk of default is less than 1%. Underwriters will be required to review applications for members deemed to have a higher level of credit risk, such as: poor credit history, high debt-to-income or low discretionary income, instability of employment, high levels of revolving credit, a strong likelihood of bankruptcy or other factors that indicate the potential borrower is more likely to default on the loan than the credit union\u2019s desired risk threshold. 3. Management will report delinquency and charge-off data as well as the overall portfolio quality and performance to ALCO and the BOD at least annually. Adhering to this guidance and effective monitoring will help ensure the high quality of our loan portfolio. Furthermore, sound credit analysis will precede all loan decisions and the Credit Union will be prudent in its automated loan approval process. 7. Other Information and Documentation Required 1. Credit applications may be taken via phone, the Internet, mail or in person. We will not retain/maintain paper applications but will use our LOS as our application source and documentation file. The Credit Union Note and Security Agreement (or applicable Master Plan agreements) must be signed by the borrowers/members. By signing the required documents, the member is agreeing to the general provisions of the credit agreement and security agreement as well as the loan terms agreed upon at the time of the loan advance. Once an open-end or line of credit account is established, AmeriCU may occasionally or routinely verify the members' credit standing has not deteriorated, but may not require a new application to be underwritten. If we determine the members' creditworthiness has deteriorated, we may suspend the line, decrease the credit limit, or refuse any future advances. The specific advance is not independently underwritten for an open-end, replenishing account. 2. Normal underwriting steps will be followed at the time of each new closed-end loan request and at the time an open-end line of credit is initially established or subsequently increased. Complete application, with all financial information included, will then be reviewed as follows: 1. Income Insight data provided by Experian is used when the borrower has a credit score above 629. Income Insight uses the employment entered into the application, compares the reported income for the same employment for the applicants' location and returns an estimated income for the applicant. This estimated income is verified to the applicants stated income and the lower amount is used in the application. 2. Verification of the applicant's stated income is obtained to determine the applicant's capacity to repay the loan. However, Underwriter discretion can be exercised to waive income requirements based on the following: 1. The application is the result of marketing pre-approvals where the Credit Union has evaluated the applicant's ability to pay based on credit bureau data. These applications are generally identified as pre-approval applications. 2. The borrower/member has a longstanding positive relationship with AmeriCU. The application documentation should note this. 3. The difference in the stated and estimated income does not have a material change in the borrowers' affordability or capacity. 4. We have booked another loan application for the borrower within the last 30 days. The application documentation should note the previous application number where income was verified. 3. The reason for waiving verification of income must be documented in the application notes. 4. The Credit Union will obtain information needed to determine the applicant's willingness and capacity to pay with regard to all loan applications, including the initial opening of any open-end line of credit products. After an open-end account is created the Credit Union may obtain such information as it may from time to time require to confirm the borrower has not had a change in their address or employment or financial stability, but not in connection with any particular advance under the terms of an existing line of credit. This shall not prohibit the Credit Union from obtaining prudent financial information associated with a change in the terms of an existing open-end credit agreement (example: an increase in the existing credit limit or a new advance). 5. A credit bureau report for all applicants, guarantors and/or co-signers will be obtained for all credit applications unless waived for the following situations: 1. An existing credit report is on file and is less than 30 days old 2. The credit application is the result of a pre-approval or pre-qualification offer where the Credit Union utilized recent credit bureau information to make the offer 3. The loan is to be secured by the borrower's Credit Union deposit account 6. Experian is the credit bureau of choice. However, the Credit Union may utilize any or all national bureaus to obtain a credit file and may choose to obtain more than one credit report for the applicant if we have reason to believe the first report may not contain a complete or accurate history for the applicant in question. We will determine our credit risk tolerance at the time the loan was originated based on the Credit Union's business needs. The acceptable limitations at any given time are referenced in our product guidelines maintained within the LOS. 7. All information and documentation necessary to perfect the Credit Union's security interest should be obtained and properly filed with the appropriate filing authorities. 8. Loan Officers 1. Lending employees are responsible for administering borrowing relationships in a manner that ensures a prompt response to member/customer requests while protecting the Credit Union to the fullest extent possible/practicable. The following is a nonexclusive listing of requirements for loan officers. These employees are obligated to perform duties that will help us manage the portfolio in a way that will minimize the negative effect three classes of loans have on our overall portfolio: 1. Under priced loans 2. High-risk loans 3. Loans that are difficult and/or expensive to administer, thus creating an excess burden on staff (example: mortgage loans made to a revocable trust) 2. Credit Files 1. Each loan officer is responsible for ensuring that a loan file is established for each loan application by utilizing the LOS in use at the time of the origination of the application. The LOS file must be well documented and contain all the information necessary to enable another loan officer to quickly determine the status of a borrower (and any other parties such as guarantors) and their loan application. All exceptions to thresholds and guidelines must be documented by the approving Underwriter(s). If Executive Review is required, the approving Executive must ensure the file is appropriately documented as well. 2. Each loan file must contain, at a minimum, the following items: 1. All required data fields in the LOS must be completed and/or updated truthfully and accurately with each new loan request. For pre-approved loans or special marketing promotions, loan files must be documented as such in order to waive normally required data 2. Sufficient financial and credit information on all borrowers to ensure the Credit Union is making a fully informed decision on the loan [unless the loan is secured completely by a deposit owned by the borrower (or proper pledging party) and such deposit is with the Credit Union]. This may also include payoff statements, lien satisfactions and such documentation that may be requested by the underwriter(s) 3. All necessary collateral documents for the Credit Union's efforts to perfect the lien on the collateral. These documents must be stored in the LOS with the appropriate application 4. Documentation regarding the purchase, sale or improvements being made to property being used as collateral for the loan 5. Files must fully document compensating factors when one or all of the borrowers' credit history, risk scores, discretionary income, or DTI does not meet our thresholds and/or if the credit report indicates the borrowers have more in unpaid collections or judgments than our guidelines allow 6. Full documentation and notes regarding the approval of high-risk loan approvals, including those loans subject to the high LTV capital limitation 7. Exceptions made by the Underwriter must be documented to ensure accurate reporting is provided to Experian to effectively. 3. Collateral 1. Each loan employee is trained as to the responsibilities for ensuring all documentation necessary for perfection of the Credit Union's lien rights. This documentation is to be obtained prior to the disbursement of any loan proceeds. In instances where loan documentation is of a complex nature, the assistance of legal counsel should be requested. 2. If standard underwriting criteria are met, the Credit Union does not require additional collateral and/or credit enhancements. There may be situations where the Credit Union will consider taking enhancement features if all underwriting criteria are not satisfied. These situations will be addressed on a case-by-case basis and must be fully explained and supported in the loan documentation. 3. For share secured loans the Credit Union will loan up to 100% of the shares being pledged as collateral. For share certificates pledged as collateral, the maturity of the loan cannot extend beyond the maturity date of the certificate being pledged. Any unpaid interest due at the time of loan maturity must be paid before the pledge/hold on the funds will be released. The hold on funds should reduce as the loan balance reduces, maintaining a hold equal to the principal loan balance. 4. Conflicts of Interest 1. Each loan officer will avoid making loans when other considerations may affect either their credit judgment or their ability to subsequently use routine collection techniques. Under no circumstances should an employee approve or process a loan for a relative, close personal friend, subordinate or supervisor [refer to the ACU-03-003 Loans to Official and Employees policy for further guidance on employee and Official loans.] Such loan officer must not attempt to influence the decision of the underwriter and affect the proper processing of the loan application. No employee is exempt from this requirement. 2. AmeriCU also has a Code of Ethics/Conflict of Interest Policy that should be referenced for further details or concerns (refer to the Employee Handbook). 5. Loan Decisions 1. Members may request the credit union to reconsider a denied loan application. The appeal must be in writing and submitted on the credit union's LAR Form which must be obtained from our Financial Centers or Member Service Center. The completed form must indicate whether the appeal is based on a plea concerning credit worthiness and/or ability to repay or, on unfair and/or unequal treatment. 2. Where there is any indication that the basis of the appeal is discrimination, partiality, prejudice or bias, on the part of the Credit Union, the request will immediately be referred to the Chief Lending Officer . They will be responsible for addressing the complaint and any internal corrective actions needed. 3. All other appeals will be processed as follows: 1. The LAR Form will be forwarded to the original disapproving Underwriter for reconsideration. If the disapproving Underwriter is not available, or they uphold their original decision, the appeal request will then be reviewed by the Underwriter's direct Supervisor/Manager. 2. If the Underwriter's direct Supervisor/Manager upholds the denial, and the member requests further review, the appeal will be forwarded to the Chief Lending Officer. 9. Fair Lending 1. The Credit Union is an equal credit opportunity and equal housing lender. The Credit Union strictly prohibits discriminatory practices of any kind in its lending programs. The Credit Union also periodically reviews its policies, procedures and credit underwriting standards in its efforts to ensure compliance with the principles of the \"fair lending laws\" (The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Act and The Fair Housing Act). If the Credit Union discovers any such practices, it will stop them immediately and take corrective action. Refer to the Credit Union's ACU-03-016 Fair Lending policy for further information. 10. Member Business Lending 1. AmeriCU Credit Union [AmeriCU] believes that a sound business-lending program represents a safe means of employing funds available for investment and a productive way to serve our membership. Authorized credit union personnel may be expected to develop loan and deposit relationships with businesses within the Credit Union's field of membership, while adhering to prudent practices. A MBL is defined by regulation as being a loan, line of credit, or letter of credit where the borrower uses the proceeds for commercial, corporate, agricultural, business investment property or venture purposes. Section 723.1 of NCUA's regulations indicates the exceptions to loans that would otherwise fall under this definition and defines \"net member business loan.\" Loan amounts of $50,000 or less may not be considered business loans per Section 723.1. Please refer to ACU-03-007 Commercial Loan Policy for further details. 11. Overdrafts 1. The Credit Union may, at its discretion, allow members in good standing to overdraw their checking accounts on a short-term basis. Management will establish minimum standards, such as minimum length of membership, credit score, or other criteria, to determine which members will be eligible for overdraft protection Members must cover an overdraft within 30 days or less either by depositing funds or obtaining an approved loan. For each item that causes an overdraft or increases the member's overdraft balance, the Credit Union will charge a fee equal to the NSF fee disclosed on its fee schedule. Prior to assessing a fee for ATM and one-time debit card transaction overdrafts, the Credit Union will provide members with the right to opt in, or affirmatively consent, to the Credit Union\u2019s overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions for each account, pursuant to the AmeriCU Overdraft Policy ACU-05-001. 12. Exceptions 1. Some provisions are made for loan requests from credit worthy borrowers whose credit needs do not fit the Credit Union's lending policy. The Credit Union may provide for prudently underwritten exceptions to its lending policies, including loan-to-value limits or credit quality, on a loan-by-loan basis. However, any exceptions should conform to the aggregate or concentration limits on such loans. Other credit exceptions may be approved within the authority of underwriters as detailed in the Credit Union's Underwriting Guidelines. Exceptions outside the scope of an Underwriter must be approved by a Level 5 authorized employee or by the Chief Executive Officer. Please see ACU-03-013 Loan Exception Policy for further details. 13. Compliance Statement 1. This policy meets the requirements of federal regulations and applicable state laws. If the Credit Union makes a loan in a state other than a state in which it conducts its principle or a significant amount of business, it will ensure that the Credit Union's documents comply with that state's laws by obtaining appropriate state approved forms or legal advice as needed. Further, the Credit Union will ensure that any security interest or mortgage/deed of trust fully complies with applicable state's laws. An opinion or advice from an attorney licensed to practice in that particular state should be obtained to document these issues when it is appropriate to do so. 2. The Credit Union's Chief/Executive Leadership Team, Board of Directors and such persons or committees as they designate shall regularly review and when appropriate, revise this policy, the procedures and guidelines to ensure compliance with applicable laws and the safety and soundness of the Credit Union. 14. Accountability (Roles & Responsibilities) Board of Directors 1. The Board of Directors will formally adopt this policy. In addition, the Board will remain informed of our lending performance through periodic evaluation of internal audits and NCUA examination reports. The Board will hold Credit Union personnel accountable for our lending performance. 2. Chief/Executive Leadership. The CEO, the Chief Lending Officer and other Leaders of the Credit Union will assure that an appropriate lending program is established to comply with the policy stated above. They will also assure that a positive fair lending culture exists in the Credit Union, beginning with their example and behavior. Executive management will hold Credit Union personnel accountable for lending performance. 3. Other Staff. All personnel are expected to cooperate with and support our lending compliance efforts. Staff will be held accountable for any lack of cooperation that weakens our performance, as reflected in internal audits, NCUA examinations, and/or member complaints RESOURCES/REFERENCES eCFR :: 12 CFR Part 1026 -- Truth in Lending (Regulation Z) eCFR :: 12 CFR Part 1002 -- Equal Credit Opportunity Act (Regulation B) eCFR :: 12 CFR Part 1022 -- Fair Credit Reporting (Regulation V) 12 C.F.R. \u00a7701 Appendix A Federal Credit Union Bylaws 12 C.F.R. \u00a7723 Member Business Loans, Commercial Lending ACU-03-001 Consumer Loan Rate Pricing Policy ACU-03-014 Appraisal Policy ACU-03-007 Commercial Loan Policy ACU-01-004 Approval/Authority Limits Policy ACU-03-002 Managed Risk Lending Policy ACU-03-013 Loan Exception Policy ACU-03-016 Fair Lending ACU-03-003 Loans to Official and Employees ACU-05-001 AmeriCU Overdraft Policy (Member Privilege) Employee Handbook PREVIOUSLY KBID 5550, Loan Officers Policy 5.01, Secured Loans 5.12, Refinancing Loan Balances 5.05, Amortization and Payment of Loans 5.04, Unsecured Loans 5.11, Loans to Minors 5.08, Pledge of Share Certificates 5.13, Members' Appeals on Disapproved Loans 5.09, Co Signer (Guarantor) Qualifications 5.06, and Credit Cards 5.14 ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTORS N/A", "policystat_url_direct": "https://americu.policystat.com/policy/17553591/", "policystat_url_latest": "https://americu.policystat.com/policy/17553591/latest/", "policystat_url_guest_access": "https://americu.policystat.com/?lt=cEdmjq-OJYCVZNejpWpI-e&next=%2Fpolicy%2F17553591%2Flatest%2F", "tags": ["Board Approved", "Compliance Department Review"]}, {"name": "ACU-04-001 Corporate Credit Card Policy", "id": 15966755, "category_name": "ACU-04 Card Services", "author_name": "Duddleston, Holly: Manager, Card Services & ATM", "applicability_group_name": "AmeriCU Credit Union", "text_preview": "POLICY STATEMENT This is to have guidelines in place for use and placement on AmeriCU Corporate Credit Cards. SCOPE This policy encompasses any Corporate Credit Card issued for any staff at AmeriCU and the expectations and responsibilities of those using them. DEFINITIONS N/A RESPONSIBILITY This Policy is for all staff. AmeriCU corporate credit card is a card owned by AmeriCU and is provided to an employee as a privilege that may be revoked at any time for any reason. The card cannot be used to obtain cash advances, bank checks, traveler's checks, or electronic cash transfers (other than for legitimate work-related expenses incurred by the assigned employee named on the card), or for any personal expenses. Without limiting AmeriCU's right to revoke an employee's possession of a corporate credit card, misuses of a corporate credit card will result in cancellation of the card and withdrawal of corporate credit card privileges. If the card is used for an employee's personal expenses, the employer reserves the right to recover these monies from the employee cardholder. All corporate credit card cardholders are accordingly required to sign a declaration authorizing the company to recover, from the employee's salary, any amount incorrectly expended through the use of a corporate credit card as a precondition of receiving a corporate credit card. Regular, full-time employees may apply for a corporate credit card with prior, written approval from their supervisor using the Corporate Credit Card Authorization Form within Knowledge base or related content. To be eligible for a corporate credit card, an employee must travel frequently in the course of his/her duties, purchase significant volumes of goods and services for use by the employer, and/or incur other regular frequent business expenses of a kind appropriately paid by credit card. All requests to increase the credit limit of a corporate credit card will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis (in writing) with Chief level authorization. Corporate credit card expenditures must be reconciled and submitted with original receipts (if available, and, otherwise, with copies of receipts) to the Accounting/Finance Department within 15 business days of the statement date. Cardholders who have not reconciled and submitted their monthly expenditure within this period will be asked to reconcile and submit immediately. Continued or repeated non-conformance with this policy will result in cancellation of the card and such other actions as appropriate. If the card expenditures are not reconciled and submitted within a month of the statement date and a plausible explanation has not been received, the employee's corporate credit card will decline transactions until brought current. Lost or stolen cards must be reported immediately to the Card Services Department.

AmeriCU has approved the use of an \"automated overdraft protection program\" to facilitate the efficient use of internal resources and provide for the consistent handling of items submitted for payment on consumer accounts with non-sufficient balances. The purpose of this policy is to communicate this program to ensure compliance with NCUA regulations. SCOPE All AmeriCU Employees DEFINITIONS RESPONSIBILITY 1. Finance Department will monitor and report the overdraft program to ensure compliance with approved tolerance, as reported on the NCUA call report form 5300. 2. The overdraft protection program implemented by AmeriCU is not contractual in nature, but it generally provides for the automatic payment of a modest overdraft limit on all of the accounts \"in good standing\" when the account is accessed using the traditional paper-based check processing, an ACH transaction, online bill payment and recurring debit card transactions. We will also apply this same overdraft limit when authorizing and paying ATM and one-time debit card transactions when the member requests us to, but only after (1) the member has received and understood the Courtesy Pay A-9 Notice (2) we have received the member's formal \"opt-in\" request, and (3) we have provided the member with a written confirmation of the request. This request may be revoked by the member at any time. \"In good standing\" simply means that the member (1) demonstrates responsible account management \u2013 such as making regular deposits to bring the account to a positive end of day balance at least once every 30 days (including the payment of all overdraft fees and charges); (2) avoids excessive overdrafts suggesting the use of the courtesy overdraft program as a continuing line of credit, and (3) there are no legal orders, levies or liens against the account. 3. New members will automatically have the overdraft protection program 30 or more days after the account is opened. This is provided they have maintained satisfactory activity in the account, including regular deposits, consistent with our internal standards for new account types that may offer Courtesy Pay. 4. Overdraft limits are established for all of our members without discrimination using a risk assessment approach for each account classification. This approach includes a systemic review and evaluation of the normal deposit flows made to each account classification to establish reasonable and prudent negative balance limits that would be routinely repaid by normal, expected, and reoccurring deposits. This risk assessment \"by portfolio approach\" assumes a minimal degree of undetermined credit risk associated with some unidentified individual accounts. This credit risk will be estimated, and a segregation of the general allowance for loans and leases should be established and maintained for such potential losses. Both the overdraft limits and the loan loss reserve should be monitored on an ongoing basis with adjustments made commensurate to actual losses and the risk tolerance profile established by the Board of Directors. 5. In accordance with NCUA regulations Part 701.21, AmeriCU has established the maximum overdraft amount that will be paid by the institution for each member and has established a cap on the total amount of outstanding overdrafts that it will pay during any given business day. Each member is informed and provided information that clearly explains the program in the Membership and Account Agreement. The maximum amount of outstanding overdrafts that the institution will allow is established to be five percent of net worth (i.e., regular reserve and undivided earnings). The total of all outstanding overdraft limits not used is also to be reflected on the NCUA call report form 5300 as an unfunded liability in accordance with call report instructions; however the total liability funded is not to exceed the cap amount provided for in this policy. 6. This overdraft policy provides for a change in traditional banking methodologies and practices that were intended to penalize members for inadvertent overdrafts. The policy also recognizes the value perceived by consumers who do make mistakes when institutions pay their overdrafts as a \"courtesy service\" in lieu of returning the items unpaid. AmeriCU continues to encourage its members to manage their finances responsibly. This policy is not intended to replace traditional lines of credit associated with overdraft protection loan programs. 7. Fee structure 1. For the purposes of this policy, \"Courtesy Pay Overdraft Fee\" (CP Overdraft Fee) fee refers to the fee charged when an item presented against insufficient funds is paid. \"Return Item Non-Sufficient Funds Fee\" (Return Item Fee) refers to the fee charged when an item is presented against insufficient funds and returned unpaid. 2. Fees charged for both returned items and paid items are to be established based on a return of processing costs with an amount of profit and recognition of competitor fees for similar services. The fee charged for paying the items is not to exceed the fee charged for returning the items. The CP Overdraft Fee and/or Return Item Fee will be charged on each item processed. No additional fees (either daily overdraft balance fees or interest) shall be charged. The current Courtesy Pay Overdraft Fee and Return Item Fee amounts that will be charged to members, as authorized by this policy and approved by the Board of Directors in accordance with NCUA regulations part 701.21 can be found on our Truth In Savings Fee Schedule. Additionally, no overdraft fee will be assessed for one-time use point-of-sale terminal transactions or ATM transactions that cause an account to become overdrawn when the member has not \"opted in\" for these transactions to be authorized and paid using the limit. 3. FC managers are discouraged from changing overdraft limit balances or waiving overdraft fees for individual accounts. The waiver of fees may be appropriate when the member expresses a clear lack of understanding of the program during the implementation period of the automated program for all members and for subsequent new members after implementation. In such cases, the overdraft courtesy program should be explained to these first-time users, and an option provided to remove the member from program coverage. 8. Overdrafts of credit union employees 1. To ensure that employees understand the program and can communicate clearly with credit union members, employees should be provided access to the same limits as credit union members. As described in NCUA 701.21, (d) (5) \"The rates, terms and conditions on any loan or line of credit either made to, or endorsed or guaranteed by (i) an official, (ii) an immediate family member of an official, or (iii) any individual having a common ownership, investment or other pecuniary interest in a business enterprise with an official or with an immediate family member of an official shall not be more favorable than the rates, terms and conditions for comparable loans or lines of credit to other credit union members.\" 9. Reporting of overdrafts to credit bureaus 1. Overdrafts that are paid in accordance with the automated program are not to be reported as overdrafts in either aggregate amounts or in the number of times overdrawn. Members who fail to adhere to the requirement of remaining in good standing as defined in the deposit account agreement and related disclosures should be counseled. It is the goal of AmeriCU to retain its deposit members and every effort will be made to maintain its members and return them to good standing. 10. Charge-off policy 1. The institution's overdraft program requires all overdrafts to be brought current either by the deposit of member funds or the establishment of an approved loan within 30 days. The Board of Directors recognizes NCUA regulations provided for a time limit not to exceed 45 days, however AmeriCU has determined that 30 days should be sufficient for members to bring their accounts to a positive balance. Overdrafts that are deemed uncollectible should be immediately charged off as stipulated in the NCUA guidance governing the Allowance for Loans and Lease Losses. In accordance with the NCUA Guidance on Overdraft Protection Programs and an NCUA legal opinion, the maximum days a member's overdraft may be carried by AmeriCU is 60 days. It is the policy of AmeriCU that all overdrafts 60 days or older should be charged off. 11. Payment of overdraft protection amounts at POS and ATMs 1. AmeriCU recognizing that many members use technology to access their share draft accounts, and in keeping with those needs, will provide the member access to the established overdraft program amounts at both the point-of-sale terminal using \"debit cards\" and at the ATM machine. In order to comply with Reg E, members must \"opt in\" to be granted access to the overdraft limit amounts for the authorization of ATM and one-time debit card transactions. Members who request an available balance at the ATM will be provided their available balance without the limit included. AmeriCU recognizes that it is imperative that members understand what is contained in their Available Balance to avoid unintentional overdrafts and the related fees. AmeriCU will make every effort to assure members are well educated about their balances and are able to make informed decisions when withdrawing funds from ATMs. Credit union policy allows for the return of initial overdraft fees caused by ATM access for first-time users who complain that they did not understand how to use this available balance feature, with an additional \"opt out\" opportunity provided at the time of counseling and refund. 12. Payment order of checks presented 1. In the normal course of business we generally pay electronic transactions first and then checks beginning with the lowest dollar amount. We reserve the right to change this order of payment if we suspect fraud or possible illegal activity affecting the account. 13. Ongoing monitoring of member activity 1. Management periodically monitors overdraft activity reports for accuracy and to identify members who appear to be continually using the overdraft protection program may be incurring unnecessary fees and may benefit from education and alternative products the credit union has to offer. Refer to KB for Overdraft Monitoring Procedures. 14. Overdraft disclosure 1. The specific terms and conditions are contained in the _\"Membership And Account Agreement\"_ and considered an integral part of this policy. AmeriCU may change the terms, conditions, and fees within the Courtesy Pay Overdraft Program in accordance with general parameters established in this Overdraft Policy that will be disclosed to our members in the Membership And Account Agreement and the Truth In Savings Fee Schedule. 15. Ongoing monitoring of the program 1. AmeriCU is committed to providing products and services that are in full compliance with all applicable Federal and State Laws, Rules, and Regulations. In addition, AmeriCU is committed to only provide products and services that are fair, and that allow for informed consumer choice, consistent with the principles found in the FTC Act. 2. AmeriCU has specifically reviewed its overdraft protection program under NCUA for rules that prohibit federally-insured credit unions from using advertisements or other representations that are in accurate or misrepresent the services or contracts offered. These regulations are broad enough to prohibit federally-insured credit unions from making any false representations to the public regarding their deposit accounts. 3. In accordance with this guidance, AmeriCU will periodically review all members' complaints to identify practices that have the potential to be misleading to members. 4. AmeriCU is further committed to reviewing the operations of the program in light of further regulatory guidance and will adopt additional best practices that will continue to enhance the benefits of the service to our members and to assure continued compliance with all rules and regulations.

The Cash Disbursement policy is to ensure that proper precautions are being taken for cash disbursement transactions. SCOPE VP of Finance, Regional AVPs, Deposit Operations Manager, Financial Center Managers, Teller Supervisors and Tellers DEFINITIONS The Cash Level refers to the maximum amount of cash on hand (Teller drawers, vault, recyclers, and cash dispensing machines) that a financial center should be at or below. A tolerance level of $15,000.00 is allowed and Financial Center Managers are expected to justify in writing to the VP of Finance and Regional AVP when cash level is outside the tolerance level. Cash disbursements refer to the amount of cash disbursed to a member in any given transaction. RESPONSIBILITY 1. Cash Level management is the responsibility of the Financial Center Manager. 2. Cash Disbursement by Teller is limited to $12,000 per member per day. An amount in excess of $12,000 member must be advised to order in advance. 3. The Teller Supervisor, Tellers, and Financial Center Manager are to manage the weekly cash order such that cash is at the authorized levels described below for the FC within the $15,000.00 tolerance level. 4.

When a cash disbursement of over $5,000 is requested, the member should be advised on the danger of carrying large sums of money and paying large obligations in cash. Management has the authority to refuse requests for cash more than $12,000 if the disbursement would reduce the cash level to the extent that it would impair the financial center\u2019s ability to adequately service other members between the date of the withdrawal and the date of the next cash shipment. Requests for emergency cash shipments must be approved by the Regional AVP or their designee. When the computer is down, cash disbursements by tellers are limited to $100 per member per request. 6.

SCOPE All financial center staff. Virtual Tellers (ITM Tellers), Virtual FCM, Virtual AFCM. DEFINITIONS Check Cashing is the service of exchanging a negotiable item (drafts, checks, money orders) for no more than the face value in cash. \"Local\" checks as defined in Regulation CC of the Federal Reserve Bank may be held two business days after the day of deposit respectively, determined by the routing number (MICR line) of the check. RESPONSIBILITY 1. It is the responsibility of branch/department management to implement the rules, regulations and requirements governing this policy to ensure minimal losses to the credit union. 2. In accordance with Regulation CC, the following criteria are in place for cashing checks, drafts and money orders: 1. The maker or payee of the instrument must be identified as a member or a joint owner of a member's account in this Credit Union or a member of a Credit Union. Check cashing service may be allowed for non-members for limited periods of time and/or for special situations in which it would facilitate providing services to our members. Fees may also be assessed for non-member third party payroll checks. 2. All checks drawn on another financial institution may be cashed provided the member has an active share draft account in good standing or has share or certificate savings equal to or greater than the amount of the check. An \"active\" share draft account is an account in this Credit Union which is regularly used for checking transactions. Checks cashed above $225.00 can be approved by the Senior Teller, Branch Manager or designated employee in charge. 3. Generally, funds from deposits of members shall be made available immediately. The funds may be withdrawn in cash and may be used to pay checks that the member has written. 4. For determining the availability of deposits, everyday is a business day, except Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays. If a deposit is made before 6:00 p.m. (cutoff times may be earlier at some locations) on a business day that the Credit Union is open, that day shall be considered the day of the deposit. However, if a deposit is made after 6:00 p.m. (cutoff times may be earlier at some locations) or on a day the Credit Union is not open it will be considered made on the next business day that the Credit Union is open. Refer to the local cutoff times posted in AmeriCU Branch Offices. 3. Delays May Apply on A Case-By-Case Basis: 1. Two party checks and depositor's own personal checks drawn on a local financial institution, if not enough funds are in depositor's existing share account or share draft account to cover the amount of the check; 2. Third party checks drawn on a local financial institution, if not enough funds are in depositor's existing share account or share draft account to cover the amount of the check; 3. Check is presented by member for cash or deposit under an existing account which has no active payroll deduction or active share draft account; and/or 4. Checks presented by depositor for cash or deposit with a minimum $.01 balance in a regular share account. 5. The first $225.00 checks(s) deposit into a share draft account or into a share account used for overdraft will be made available the first business day after the day of deposit. 6. If all of the funds of a deposit are not going to be made available on the day of deposit, the depositor must be notified at the time the deposit is made. At that time the depositor must be informed when the funds will be available by. If the deposit is not made directly to a teller, or if the decision to take this action is made after the depositor leaves the premises, then such notice shall be mailed to the depositor by the day after the receipt of the deposit. 4. Longer Delays Under Certain Circumstances: 1. Funds deposited by check may be delayed for a longer period under the following circumstances referred to as Exceptions: The Credit Union has reason to believe the deposited check will not be paid. The total check deposits of the member exceed $5,000.00 on any one-day. A check has been re-deposited after being returned unpaid. The depositor has overdrawn his/her/its account repeatedly in the prior six months. There is an emergency, such as failure of communications or computer equipment. 2. If a deposit is held for one of the five \"Exceptions\", then it may be held for up to seven days for \"local\" checks. The hold may be for a longer period if there is reasonable cause for a longer delay. In such circumstances the Credit Union shall notify the depositor if the funds are unavailable for any of the foregoing reasons, and such notification shall inform the depositor as to when the funds will be available. However, the first $225.00 of such deposits shall be made available on the first business day after the day of deposit. 5. Special Rules for New Accounts: 1. The following special rules will apply during the first thirty (30) days that a new member opens an account: The first $5,000.00 from a deposit of U.S. Treasury checks will be available the next business day. The excess over $5,000.00 will be available on the ninth business day after the day of the deposit. Funds from wire transfers into an account will be available on the first business day after the day that the Credit Union receives the transfer. Funds from deposits of cash and the first $5,525.00 of day\u2019s total deposits of cashier's, certified, teller's, traveler's, and state and local government checks will be available the next business day. For example, the check must be made payable to the depositor. The excess over $5,525.00 will be available on the ninth business day after the day of the deposit. If the depositor does not make the deposit in person to a teller of the Credit Union, the first $5,525.00 may not be available until the second business day after the day of the deposit. Funds from all other check deposits will be available on the ninth business day for local items after the day of the deposit. Joint owners and non-members, who have a valid power of attorney to act on behalf of a member, may cash an instrument made payable to the member, in accordance with the criteria established herein. Social security checks can not be negotiated without a valid power of attorney. Share drafts, drawn on an AmeriCU Credit Union member's share draft account with adequate shares on deposit or credit availability in a VIP account, may be cashed for properly identified payees. Management is authorized to charge a member the service fee in KB 3212 for processing a returned item each time a deposited or cashed check or draft is returned by the payable or payable through bank, and to revoke the check cashing privileges of a member who frequently cashes checks or drafts which are returned.

RESPONSIBILITY 1. It is the responsibility of branch/department management to implement this policy. The processing of multiple employee-assisted share withdrawals by check is not a cost-effective use of employee time and creates delays in service to other members. NCUA regulations prohibit charging a fee for share withdrawals by check drawn on the Credit Union\u2019s bank account. Thus, the only available control to reduce cost and expedite member service is to invoke the bylaw authority for notice of withdrawal. 2. Official checks can be issued to members at the in-person teller windows. Official checks cannot be provided by Virtual Teller via ITM's. The minimum amount in which official checks can be issued at the teller window is $50.00 unless closing an account with a balance under $50.00. These checks can only be payable to the member and mailed to the member address as it is on their account. The first two check requests in any given month are free of charge. For three check requests or more, refer to KBID 3212 Service Fee Schedule / Truth in Savings Disclosure for Checking and Savings. 3.

Refer to KBID 3212 Service Fee Schedule / Truth in Savings Disclosure for Checking and Savings for official check fees. Members who request multiple share withdrawals by check should be encouraged to open a share draft account and pay their obligations by draft. Members must be advised, at the time of purchase, that stop payment orders will not be executed on the instrument prior to 90 days from the purchase date on the instrument When a member presents a payment for an official check, the transaction for purchase should be done under the member\u2019s account number.

SCOPE All AmeriCU Employees DEFINITIONS Telecommuter \\- A telecommuter is an employee who works for AmeriCU from home or at an appropriate off-site remote office for all or some of the employee's regularly scheduled workweek. After exploring whether telecommuting is appropriate for a financial institution such as AmeriCU, AmeriCU has determined telecommuting is a viable work option for certain employees. Designated Office for Telecommuting Employees: Any employee in a telecommuting arrangement will also be assigned a designated office at an AmeriCU facility. Travel to and from the employee's designated office shall not be reimbursed, although travel to an office or location other than the employee's designated office may be reimbursed subject to AmeriCU's then- applicable mileage reimbursement policy. Fully Remote : Fully Remote employees are those that telecommute for substantially all of their work schedule throughout a given calendar year. For the sake of clarity, although Fully Remote employees will be given a designated office, and may also be required to travel for certain meetings or events, as determined to be appropriate solely by any of the employee's supervisors, Fully Remote employees are those who are otherwise required to come into AmeriCU facilities only rarely for specific meetings or events at the specific request of a supervisor, and do not have any routine, regular, or expected cadence of working from their designated office. Hybrid : Hybrid employees spend some working time at their designated office and other working time telecommuting on a regular schedule or cadence determined by the employee and the employee's direct supervisor together. For the sake of clarity, any employee who has been directed to work at their designated office at least once per month is a Hybrid employee. Additionally, Hybrid employees may be required to travel to any location of AmeriCU's choosing, even on days the employee is otherwise scheduled to telecommute, for meetings or events as determined to be appropriate solely by any of the employee's supervisors. RESPONSIBILITY Telecommuting is not a guaranteed work option for any employee or position but, rather, is voluntary on the part of the supervisor and employee. Accordingly, telecommuting is not available unless an employee has first read and agreed to AmeriCU's Telecommuting Agreement. Additionally, telecommuting may not be possible for certain positions at AmeriCU. All telecommuting arrangements will be made on a case-by-case basis, focusing on the business needs of AmeriCU first while taking into consideration each individual employee's situation. Job performance and meeting business demands must remain the focus of any telecommuting arrangement. It is expected for any telecommuting arrangement that the telecommuting employee will ensure the home work environment is quiet and free from any type of unreasonable background noise. Telecommuting employees are further expected to arrange primary care for dependents (minors & dependent adults) during work hours so as not to disrupt work schedules and productivity. Employees with approved telecommuting arrangements must be available to leave their home on short notice at any time during the employee's normal working hours if business needs dictate it. One purpose of AmeriCU's Telecommuting Agreement is to achieve these goals, and, as noted, above, all telecommuting employees must agree to AmeriCU's Telecommuting Agreement as a precondition to commencing any telecommuting arrangement. Any telecommuting arrangement made between AmeriCU and an employee may be discontinued at any time, for any reason, at the request of either the employee or AmeriCU. If a telecommuting arrangement is discontinued, the employee will comply with the terms of the Telecommuting Agreement applicable to discontinued arrangements. Importantly, telecommuting does not change the basic terms and conditions of employment. Telecommuters remain subject to all AmeriCU's usual employment policies and procedures. For example, if any unlawful harassment and discrimination occurs at the telecommuter's work site, AmeriCU should be notified immediately. Entering a telecommuting arrangement does not guarantee continued employment and does not change the at-will nature of the employment relationship. At all times, all AmeriCU employees are \"at will\" unless the employee has another specific arrangement with AmeriCU. At AmeriCU, if a telecommuting arrangement is available and appropriate for an employee, it will consist of a Fully Remote arrangement or a Hybrid arrangement. AmeriCU reserves the right to instruct any employee to temporarily telecommute as circumstances might require (for example, due to a public health emergency, significant weather event, or other appropriate circumstance as determined solely by AmeriCU). _In such situations, the terms of AmeriCU's Telecommuting Agreement shall apply to the temporary telecommuting arrangement even if the employee has not previously agreed to the terms as part of an existing telecommuting program._ Employee will provide internet access and a router, that is no older than 3 years of age. The Credit Union is not responsible for providing, configuring or paying for internet access or a router. MTS will not offer troubleshooting or contact the Employee's home internet provider on their behalf. Employee's inability to telecommute due to any issue the Employee has with internet access, whether caused by the Employee's internet provider, router, or otherwise, may result in the Employee being marked absent by the Employee's direct supervisor for the corresponding period of time. In such a case, the Employee may be required to utilize PTO or, if no PTO is available, take unpaid leave. If MTS determines the employee\u2019s issue is due to inadequate internet speeds and/or home router issues, the employee can be requested back to the office until proof of repair is made.

Therefore, the credit union has adopted this vehicle policy that requires all employees who operate credit union-owned vehicles during the performance of their jobs, to do so in a lawful, safe and courteous manner. Use of said vehicles is restricted to business purposes only. Credit union employees are not allowed to use said vehicles for personal purposes, unless it has been pre-approved. SCOPE This policy lists expectations for those employees that will operate an AmeriCU Credit Union owned vehicle. DEFINITIONS N/A RESPONSIBILITY The senior manager in the division where the vehicle is operated is responsible for the implementation and on-going administration of this policy. 1. An employee who, through the credit union\u2019s authorization process, is asked to operate any credit union vehicle may do so only after submitting to Human Resources the required acceptance of responsibility and acknowledgement of the credit union policy (Refer to the Powerform attached in the Reference section) (signed by the appropriate member(s) of the Senior Management Team) and associated documentation. Associated documentation includes the signed authorization to perform a Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) check and a current copy of the employee\u2019s driver\u2019s license. No unauthorized persons will be permitted to operate a credit union-owned vehicle at any time, with the exception of an emergency when the authorized driver is incapacitated. 2. Since the credit union has discretion in determining who may operate credit union-owned vehicles, the credit union has the right to review any appropriate documents including driving records, proof of a valid license, automobile insurance information, etc. Employees authorized to operate said vehicles must make his/her manager, IIRS and Human Resources aware of any driving violations, changes to driver information, and/or driver status immediately, whether in their personal vehicle or the credit union vehicle. 3. Employees are expected to take all steps necessary to avoid endangering themselves and others while operating credit union-owned vehicles. Employees authorized to operate said vehicles are expected to: Ensure that all occupants (including himself/herself), wear safety belts when the vehicle is in operation. Ensure that the vehicle to which the employee is assigned is maintained in a safe driving condition. Refrain from using cellular telephones (unless they are equipped with hands-free capability) and/or personal listening devices, and from conducting any other activities which may impede the driver\u00b4s ability to focus on operating the vehicle safely while it is in motion. Comply with respective laws governing motor vehicle operations, and obey all speed limits. Remember that the employee is a representative of the Credit Union and treat other drivers and pedestrians in a courteous, safe manner. Additional Expectations: All employees approved to drive credit union vehicles will not be under the influence of alcohol while driving said vehicle. All employees approved to drive credit union vehicles will submit an authorization form to Human Resources to process a DMV check. The employee must ensure that a current copy of his/her driver\u2019s license is on file with Human Resources at all times. If the employee pays for gas purchases with his/her funds, he/she may submit the appropriate documentation for reimbursement. Otherwise, no mileage reimbursement will be provided to the employee as the credit union supplies the vehicle and the fuel. Division employees will ensure that proper, timely vehicle maintenance is performed. Vehicle registration will be filled out by the division. Accounts Payable/Finance division will process the payment with the DMV. Required insurance information will be provided by the division to IIRS division. The IIRS division will ensure that adequate insurance coverage is obtained. Accounts Payable/Finance division will process the payment with the carrier. Payment for violation tickets will be the responsibility of the driver. Accidents involving the credit union vehicle will be reported promptly to the IIRS division to ensure the claim is processed timely. Employee will ensure that the travel log has been updated for each usage. The travel log will include the following information: who drove the vehicle, where the vehicle was driven, purpose for using the vehicle, mileage before and at the end of each trip, and the date of maintenance. Any individual who is in violation of the expectations listed above may be subject to disciplinary action by the credit union up to and including termination of employment.

The receiving employee has exhausted all their paid time off (PTO, Birthday, NYS Paid Sick Leave (part-time employees) or Floating Holiday (when applicable) before receiving donated time off under this policy. The receiving employee may initiate the vacation donation request process in anticipation of exhausting their accrued paid time off. The receiving employee is not covered by or is not eligible for Short-Term Disability (STD), Long-Term Disability (LTD), Worker\u2019s Compensation or other paid leave benefits when they receive the donated vacation time. The receiving employee may initiate the vacation donation request process in anticipation of the expiration of such benefits. RESPONSIBILITY How to Donate: Annually AmeriCU will allow employees to donate up to 24 hours of their unused accrued Vacation/PTO time. This will occur in conjunction with the annual cash out/carryover program that is already in place. Donated time is based on your accrual balances on December 31st. This is a great way to donate unused time that would normally be lost to you, should you have more than 80 hours in your bank at the end of year. How it Works: A donating employee can donate a minimum of 2 hours and a maximum of 24 hours to the pool of time off. Only previously accrued vacation/PTO time may be donated. Donations must be made in the form of time off from work and cannot be \u201ccashed out\u201d for the equivalent dollar value of that time off. Donations will not be reversed. By submitting your request to donate time you are approving HR to remove the time from your Vacation/PTO balance. The receiving employee can receive a maximum of 4 weeks of donated time off in a rolling 12-month period. The number of weeks allowed is based on the length of time the employee needs to be off work to care for their serious illness/injury or their immediate family member\u2019s serious illness/injury, which may be less than 4 weeks. The number of hours paid per week (up to a maximum of 40) will be based on the employee\u2019s current status. Full-time employees will be eligible for a maximum of 8 hours per day/40 hours per week. Part-time employees will receive an average per day/week based on the last 12 months. Donations are received on a first come, first give basis. Donations will be denied when the receiving employee reaches their maximum donation amount. Donated vacation/PTO time will be transferred on an hour-to-hour basis. Donated time off cannot be used retroactively (i.e., for pay periods prior to receiving the donation). Donated time off cannot be cashed out at any time. The Donation Process: The requesting employee must contact Human Resources to discuss their need for leave and to make the request for the donated PTO. In cases where the employee is incapacitated and unable to make the request, it can come from the employee\u2019s manager or may be initiated by HR. The CTO and AVP, HR will review the request and communicate next steps appropriately with the employee and their manager. Donating employees will need to include their donations on the end of year form \u2013 PTO Payout & Donation Form. The full list of donated time will be maintained by HR, time on the list will transfer over from year to year but will expire three years after it has been donated. Leaving AmeriCU Receiving employees will not be paid for unused donated PTO time if they leave AmeriCU before the time is exhausted. PTO benefits will not be paid during any resignation period to extend the employee\u2019s resignation period or time of service with the Credit Union.

SCOPE This policy applies to all employees, including Full-time, part-time and temporary workers at AmeriCU Credit Union. DEFINITIONS N/A RESPONSIBILITY 1. Attendance 1. Your punctuality and regular attendance are expected and essential for efficient operations. If you know in advance you are going to be late or absent, you must notify your immediate supervisor as soon as possible, for specific requirements see below. However, when using paid time off for reasons that qualify under the New York State Paid Sick Leave Law, notice must simply be provided prior to your appointed starting time. 2. Every job at the Credit Union is important and arrangements must be made for someone to monitor your area of responsibility if you are not at work when expected. Continual absences reduce your effectiveness on the job. 3. Attendance and punctuality are important factors in determining your overall job performance. If you are absent from work for three (3) days and have not called in your absences to your immediate supervisor, you will be considered to have voluntarily terminated and your employment will be ended. If you are out of work for three (3) or more days due to illness, a doctor\u2019s note certifying your fitness to return to work will be required upon your return (unless you are on an approved leave, e.g., FMLA). 4. This policy does not apply to absences covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) or leave provided as a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). These exceptions are described in separate policies. 2. Absence 1. \"Absence\" is defined as your failure to report for work when you are scheduled to work. The two types of absences are defined below: 1. _Excused absence_ occurs when all the following conditions are met: 1. You provide your supervisor sufficient notice at least 24 hours in advance of the absence, allowing your supervisor to approve your request in advance. 2. You have sufficient accrued paid time off (PTO) to cover the absence. 2. _Unscheduled absence_ occurs when any of the above conditions are not met. 1. If it is necessary for you to be absent or late for work because of an illness or an emergency, you must notify you supervisor as soon as you know you will not be in, but it should not be later than one hour before your scheduled starting time on that same day. 2. If you are unable to call, you must have someone make the call on your behalf. 3. An unscheduled absence counts as one occurrence for the purposes of discipline under this policy. 4. Please note, only the first day of a consecutive day absence will count as unscheduled. 2. If you incur three or more consecutive days of excused absences because of illness or injury, you must give Human Resources proof of physician's care prior to returning to work. 3. You must take earned PTO for every absence unless otherwise allowed by company policy (e.g., leave of absence, bereavement, jury duty). 3. Punctuality 1. Punctual and regular attendance is an essential responsibility of each employee at AmeriCU. You are expected to report to work as scheduled, on time and be prepared to start working at your scheduled start time. You also are expected to remain at work for your entire work schedule. Late arrival, early departure or other absences from scheduled hours are disruptive and must be avoided. 2. Please note: this policy does not apply to absences covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) or leave provided as a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). These exceptions are described in separate policies. 4. Tardiness and Early Departures 1. You are expected to report to work and return from scheduled breaks on time. If you cannot report to work as scheduled, you must notify your supervisor no later than your regular starting time. This notification does not excuse the tardiness but simply notifies your supervisor that a schedule change may be necessary. 2. If you must leave work before the end of your scheduled shift, you must notify a supervisor immediately. Tardiness and early departures are each one-half an occurrence for the purpose of discipline under this policy. 5. Disciplinary Action 1. Excessive absenteeism is defined as two or more occurrences of unscheduled absence in a 30-day period or four or more occurrences of unscheduled absence in a 12-month rolling period. Excessive unscheduled absenteeism as defined here or an excessive pattern of scheduled absence or if you exhaust your annual PTO balance or are sent home after coming to work sick, will result in disciplinary action up to including termination of employment. Additionally, coming to work sick is an unscheduled absence. 6. Job Abandonment 1. Any employee who fails to report to work for a period of three days or more without notifying his or her supervisor will be considered to have abandoned the job and voluntarily terminated the employment relationship.

REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY (EEO) COMMITMENT AmeriCU prides itself on being an equal opportunity employer.

Any employee with questions or concerns regarding any type of discrimination in the workplace is encouraged to bring these issues to the attention of their supervisor or the Human Resources Department. Employees will not be retaliated against for bringing forth such concerns. Any employee found to be engaged in any type of unlawful discrimination will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. The Credit Union has certain obligations with respect to individuals with disabilities and qualified protected veterans as a result of applicable federal law and regulation. In compliance with law, the Credit Union maintains affirmative action plans for the employment of veterans and individuals with disabilities, which plans may be accessed by request to the Senior HR Operations Analyst during normal business hours. Personnel decisions are based only on valid job requirements, and we will make all reasonable accommodations necessary to employ and advance in employment qualified persons with disabilities, newly separated veterans, protected veterans, and disabled veterans. Employees of and applicants to the Credit Union will not be subject to harassment, intimidation, threats, coercion, or discrimination because they have engaged or may engage in filing a complaint, assisting in a review, investigation, or hearing or have otherwise sought to obtain their legal rights related to any federal, state, or local law regarding EEO for qualified individuals with disabilities or qualified protected veterans. PAY TRANSPARENCY AmeriCU will not discharge or in any other manner discriminate against employees or applicants because they have inquired about, discussed, or disclosed their own pay or the pay of another employee or applicant. However, employees who have access to the compensation information of other employees or applicants as a part of their essential job functions cannot disclose the pay of other employees or applicants to individuals who do not otherwise have access to compensation information, unless the disclosure is (a) in response to a formal complaint or charge, (b) in furtherance of an investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action, including an investigation conducted by the employer, or (c) consistent with the Credit Union\u2019s legal duty to furnish information. CREDIT UNION GOVERNANCE A capable and interested group of volunteer officials is essential for guiding the growth and stability of our Credit Union. The Board of Directors and Supervisory Committee serve voluntarily and comprise the elected and appointed organizational structure of the Credit Union. The Board of Directors is elected by the general Credit Union membership. Election results are announced at the Credit Union's Annual Meeting, which is held every March. The Board elects from its own number, a Chairman, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial Officer, and Recording Officer. These executive officers are responsible for administering the policies and procedures established by the Board. They are responsible to the members for the proper exercise of the authority delegated to them in the Bylaws. The Board of Directors is responsible for hiring the President-Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Credit Union. The President-CEO is the highest-ranking Credit Union employee and has an office located at our headquarters in Rome, New York. The Supervisory Committee consists of persons appointed from the membership by the Board of Directors. The Supervisory Committee performs duties as prescribed in the Bylaws, which include examining the affairs of the Credit Union, presenting reports to the Board of Directors, and annual reporting to members. No employee and/or his/her spouse may be a candidate for office. No employee and/or his/her spouse, including the President-CEO, may campaign for or support candidates for office during normal business hours or engage in such activities on the premises of the Credit Union. Participation in the affairs of other credit unions and credit associations or organizations is not restricted as long as such participation does not interfere with your Credit Union duties or responsibilities or otherwise create an actual or perceived conflict of interest. CODE OF ETHICS / CONFLICT OF INTEREST Every Director, Board Member, Committee Member, Officer, and employee must: Conduct business in an atmosphere of good faith; Seek to find and utilize more efficient and economical ways of getting their job done; Never discriminate by granting any special favors or privileges to anyone, whether or not for remuneration; Never accept for themselves or their family, any gift, benefit or unusual hospitality construed by reasonable persons as tending in any way to influence them in the performance of their duties; Never engage in business with the Credit Union either directly or indirectly which is inconsistent with the conscientious performance of their duties; Never use any information coming to them confidentially in the performance of their Credit Union duties as a means for making private profit; Never participate on behalf of the Credit Union directly or indirectly in any deliberations or decisions in which they have a monetary or personal interest, including any decisions affecting the procurement of equipment, supplies or services from any source which would give them financial gain; Never use for their personal benefit any equipment, tools, materials and supplies purchased with Credit Union funds; Never use their position with the Credit Union to manipulate others for personal gain; Disclose the facts, should any possible conflict of interest arise, so it may be determined whether a problem exists, and if so, how best to eliminate it; Expose dishonesty or corruption wherever they are discovered; Uphold these principles as fundamental to the well-being of the Credit Union and to its continued service, growth and progress; Never perform any type of transaction or file maintenance on their own or a family member\u2019s account; or any other account where there might be a potential conflict of interest; Never view any account without a legitimate business need; and Hold in the strictest confidence members\u2019 financial and other confidential information. Employees must be free from conflicts of interest that could adversely influence their judgment, objectivity or loyalty to the Credit Union in conducting business activities and assignments. Even the appearance of a conflict of interest can damage important Credit Union interests. Employees may take part in legitimate financial, business and other activities outside of their AmeriCU jobs, but any potential conflict of interest raised by those activities must be disclosed promptly to the head of their division or Human Resources. A failure to disclose a conflict of interest or a potential conflict of interest is a disciplinable offense which could result in termination of employment. In order to facilitate the above policy, employees must: Request management approval of outside activities, financial interests or business or other relationships that may pose a real or potential conflict of interest. Avoid personal relationships with other employees where parties in the relationship are in a position to receive or give unfair advantage or preferential treatment as a result of the relationship. Avoid actions or relationships that might conflict or appear to conflict with your job responsibilities or the interests of AmeriCU. According to ACU-11-027 Standards of Conduct for Officials, Employees and Agents are required to annually acknowledge in writing that they have read and understand AmeriCU\u2019s Code of Ethics as stated above. Employee Liability : Any employee, who commits the Credit Union to a purchase, sale, lease or other arrangement without proper authorization, may be personally liable for the transaction. Any Credit Union employee acting in a procurement capacity may be liable for damages to the Credit Union if they injure the Credit Union through willful misconduct, bad faith, and dishonesty or criminal negligence. Conduct by any employee that violates the Credit Union\u2019s policies, regulations or rules pertaining to Conflict of Interest/Code of Ethics, may lead to disciplinary actions, up to and including termination. FRAUD AmeriCU considers any form of fraud or dishonesty on the part of its officials and employees unacceptable conduct. If you suspect questionable and/or fraudulent activity of any employee, officer or volunteer, you should report it to the Chairman of the Supervisory Committee, Risk Management or Human Resources and it will be investigated. All information will be kept confidential and will be divulged only on a need-to-know basis. You will not be retaliated against for reporting such information. Acts considered to be either fraudulent or dishonest include, but are not limited to: Manipulation of loan accounts, documents, computer records, shares or share draft accounts; Theft of any kind, including stealing from members' accounts, over-payment of dividends and creating fictitious loans; Skipping or delaying loan payments without proper authorization; Check or share draft kiting; Forgeries; Unauthorized or unapproved salary advances or overtime reimbursement; Intentional violation of Credit Union rules, regulations, procedures, or internal controls; Intentionally failing to secure collateral, properly record a security interest in collateral or pledging a member's shares as collateral without documented authorization; Granting or requesting preferential treatment for anyone; and Accepting money or a gift of other than trivial value ( _e.g._ \u2013 a pen or t-shirt) from a member or business partner. According to ACU-11-027 Standards of Conduct for Officials, Employees and Agents\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b all Directors, Committee Members, Officers and employees are required to annually acknowledge in writing that they have read and understand AmeriCU\u2019s Fraud policy as stated above. Per PART 300 of the New York State Superintendent\u2019s Regulations, every organization organized, licensed or registered under the Banking Law shall submit a report to the superintendent immediately upon the discovery of events such as embezzlement, misapplication, larceny, forgery, fraud, dishonesty, making of false entries or other misconduct. Human Resources will work with Risk Management to ensure reporting is completed where necessary by regulation. SEXUAL AND OTHER FORMS OF HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION PREVENTION POLICY Introduction AmeriCU is committed to maintaining a work environment free from any form of unlawful harassment or discrimination. This policy is one component of AmeriCU\u2019s commitment to a discrimination-free work environment. Policy This policy applies to all employees. It also applies to individuals who are not employees of AmeriCU but are employees of contractors, subcontractors, vendors, consultants, and other persons who provide services in AmeriCU\u2019s workplace, such as interns, Board of Directors and temporary employees. These individuals include persons commonly referred to as independent contractors, gig workers, and temporary workers. Also included are persons providing equipment repair, cleaning services, or any other services through a contract with AmeriCU. For the remainder of this policy, we will use the term \u201ccovered individual\u201d to refer to these individuals who are not direct employees of the company. Sexual and other harassment and discrimination is unacceptable at AmeriCU and is prohibited by this policy. This policy prohibits not only behavior that constitutes unlawful harassment, but also other inappropriate or unprofessional behavior that may reasonably be considered offensive or otherwise inappropriate. Prohibited Harassment and Discrimination Prohibited harassment is a form of unlawful discrimination. Harassment is a discriminatory practice when it subjects an individual to inferior terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of the individual's membership in one or more of the categories protected under federal, state, or local law. Prohibited harassment includes, but is not limited to, unwelcome or inappropriate verbal, physical, or other communication or conduct that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion to an individual and/or group on the basis of race, creed, color, gender or sex, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, status of being transgender, age, religion, pregnancy, protected activity, military or veteran status, marital or familial status, citizenship or immigration status, genetic information or predisposition and carrier status, domestic violence victim status, reproductive health decision making, known relationship or association with any member of a protected class, or any other characteristic protected by applicable federal, state and/or law. Prohibited harassment may include, but is not limited to jokes, epithets, slurs, insulting sounds; negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts; offensive objects or gestures; or written or graphic material, including email, that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group on the basis of a protected characteristic. Discrimination refers to unequal or less favorable treatment in terms and conditions of employment. Unequal or less favorable treatment is prohibited on the basis of race, creed, color, gender or sex, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, status of being transgender, age, religion, pregnancy, protected activity, military or veteran status, marital or familial status, citizenship or immigration status, genetic information or predisposition and carrier status, domestic violence victim status, reproductive health decision making, known relationship or association with any member of a protected class, or any other characteristic protected by applicable federal, state and/or law. Sexual Harassment Sexual harassment is a form of gender-based discrimination that is unlawful under federal, state, and (where applicable) local law. Sexual harassment includes harassment on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, self-identified or perceived sex, gender expression, gender identity, and the status of being transgender. Sexual harassment is not limited to sexual contact, touching, or expressions of a sexually suggestive nature. Sexual harassment includes all forms of gender discrimination including gender role stereotyping and treating employees differently because of their gender. Sexual harassment can occur between any individuals, regardless of their sex or gender. Certain terms are used by some people to describe their gender identity. A cisgender person refers to someone whose gender aligns with the sex they were assigned at birth. A transgender person refers to someone whose identified gender is different than the sex they were assigned at birth. A non-binary person does not identify exclusively as a man or a woman. Sexual harassment includes any unwelcome conduct or inferior terms, conditions or privileges of employment which is either of a sexual nature, or which is directed at an individual because of that individual\u2019s sex or gender when: Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual\u2019s work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment. The impacted person does not need to be the intended target of the sexual harassment; Employment depends implicitly or explicitly on accepting such unwelcome behavior; or Decisions regarding an individual\u2019s employment are based on an individual\u2019s acceptance to or rejection of such behavior. Such decisions can include what shifts and how many hours an employee might work, project assignments, as well as salary and promotion decisions. There are two main types of sexual harassment: Behaviors that contribute to a hostile work environment include, but are not limited to, words, signs, jokes, pranks, intimidation, or physical violence which are of a sexual nature, or which are directed at an individual because of that individual\u2019s sex, gender identity, or gender expression. Sexual harassment also consists of any unwanted verbal or physical advances, sexually explicit derogatory, or discriminatory statements which an employee finds offensive or objectionable, causes an employee discomfort or humiliation, or interferes with the employee\u2019s job performance. Sexual harassment also occurs when a person in authority tries to trade job benefits for sexual favors. This can include hiring, promotion, continued employment or any other terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. This is also called quid pro quo harassment. Any employee or covered individual who feels harassed is encouraged to report the behavior so that any violation of this policy can be corrected promptly. Any harassing conduct, even a single incident, can be discrimination and is covered by this policy. In investigating reports of sexual harassment, the Credit Union will ensure due process for all parties, as outlined below. Examples of Sexual Harassment This list is just a sample of behaviors and should not be considered exhaustive. Physical acts of a sexual nature, such as: Touching, pinching, patting, kissing, hugging, grabbing, brushing against another employee\u2019s body or poking another employee\u2019s body; or Rape, sexual battery, molestation or attempts to commit these assaults, which may be considered criminal conduct outside the scope of this policy (please contact local law enforcement if you wish to pursue criminal charges). Unwanted sexual comments, advances or propositions, such as: Requests for sexual favors accompanied by implied or overt threats concerning the target\u2019s job performance evaluation, a promotion, or other job benefits; This can include sexual advances/pressure placed on a service industry employee by customers or clients, especially those industries where hospitality and tips are essential to the customer/employee relationship; Subtle or obvious pressure for unwelcome sexual activities; or Repeated requests for dates or romantic gestures, including gift-giving. Sexually oriented gestures, noises, remarks or jokes, or questions and comments about a person\u2019s sexuality, sexual experience, or romantic history which create a hostile work environment. This is not limited to interactions in person. Remarks made over virtual platforms and in messaging apps when employees are working remotely can create a similarly hostile work environment. Sex stereotyping, which occurs when someone\u2019s conduct or personality traits are judged based on other people's ideas or perceptions about how individuals of a particular sex should act or look. Asking employees to take on traditionally gendered roles, such as asking a woman to serve meeting refreshments when it is not part of, or appropriate to, her job duties. Written conduct such as authoring threatening, derogatory or offensive letters, e-mails, text messages, or social media posts. Sexual or discriminatory displays or publications anywhere in the workplace, such as: Displaying pictures, posters, calendars, graffiti, objects, promotional material, reading materials, or other materials that are sexually demeaning or pornographic. This includes such sexual displays on workplace computers or cell phones and sharing such displays while in the workplace; This also extends to the virtual or remote workspace and can include having such materials visible in the background of one\u2019s home during a virtual meeting. Hostile actions taken against an individual because of that individual\u2019s sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. Examples of Other Kinds of Harassment: This list is just a sample of behaviors and should not be considered exhaustive. Ethnic, racial, religious or other teasing or slurs, or jokes or comments that demean a person on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability or any other protected characteristic; Mimicking or mocking another\u2019s race, color, religion, ethnicity, national origin, age, disability, or any other protected characteristic; Racially or religiously offensive pictures, symbols, cartoons, or graffiti; Hostile actions taken against an individual because of the individual\u2019s protective characteristic(s), such as: sabotaging an individual\u2019s work; name-calling; interfering with, destroying or damaging a person\u2019s workstation, tools or equipment; otherwise interfering with an individual\u2019s ability to perform the job; etc. Who Can Be a Target of Harassment? Harassment may occur between members of the protected harassment group. Sexual harassment can occur between any individuals, regardless of their sex or gender. Harassment does not have to be between members of the opposite sex or gender. New York Law protects employees and all covered individuals described earlier in the policy. Harassers can be anyone in the workplace. A supervisor, a supervisee, or a coworker can all be harassers. Anyone else in the workplace can also be harassers including an independent contractor, contract worker, vendor, client, customer, patient, constituent, or visitor. Where Can Harassment Occur? Harassment is prohibited in any form at the workplace, and in any work-related setting outside the workplace, whether on or off Credit Union premises, and every situation that may impact the workplace including work-related functions, business trips, business meetings, and business-related social events. Similarly, prohibited conduct is unacceptable when it occurs when working remotely from home, on calls, texts, emails, and social media usage by employees or covered individuals can constitute unlawful workplace harassment, even if they occur away from the workplace premises, on personal devices, or during non-work hours Prohibition of Retaliation Retaliation is unlawful and includes any conduct, whether or not in the workplace or employment-related, which might deter a reasonable person from making or supporting a charge of discrimination or harassment and is directed at someone who engages in protected activity. Protected activity includes opposing a discriminatory practice, making a good faith report of a suspected violation of this policy, filing a harassment complaint, participating in an investigation or proceeding of such a report or complaint, or encouraging a fellow employee to make a report. Examples of retaliation may include, but are not limited to: Demotion, termination, denying accommodations, reduced hours, or the assignment of less desirable shifts; Publicly releasing personnel files; Refusing to provide a reference or providing an unwarranted negative reference; Undermining an individual\u2019s immigration status; or Reducing work responsibilities, passing over for a promotion, or moving an individual\u2019s desk to a less desirable office location. Even if the alleged harassment does not turn out to rise to the level of a violation of law, the individual is protected from retaliation if the person had a good faith belief that the practices were unlawful. However, the retaliation provision is not intended to protect persons making intentionally false charges of harassment. Retaliation is a violation of Credit Union policy and should be reported immediately. Anyone who believes they have been subjected to retaliation or who is aware of retaliation directed at another individual is expected to report such conduct using the procedure below. Any individual found to have engaged in retaliation will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. Reporting Policy Violations Any employee or covered individual who feels they have been subjected to, witness or otherwise become aware of any conduct that may violate this policy is strongly encouraged to report such conduct to their supervisor or manager, the AVP, Talent Solutions, the Chief Talent Officer, any Chief level officer, or the President. Reports of harassment or discrimination may be made verbally or in writing. A written reporting form is attached to this policy as Appendix A if an employee would like to use it, but the reporting form is not required. Employees who are reporting harassment or discrimination on behalf of other employees may use the reporting form and should note that it is on another employee\u2019s behalf. A verbal or otherwise written complaint (such as an email) on behalf of oneself or another employee is also acceptable. If an employee makes a report to their supervisor or manager and believes the supervisor or manager is not taking appropriate action, the employee should report this inaction to the AVP, Talent Solutions, the Chief Talent Officer, any Chief level officer, or the President. If an employee believes that his/her supervisor or manager violated this policy, then the employee should report the matter to the AVP, Talent Solutions, the Chief Talent Officer, any Chief level officer, or the President. The availability of this reporting procedure does not preclude individuals who believe they are being harassed or discriminated against from promptly advising the offender that his/her behavior is unwelcome and requesting that it be discontinued. Supervisory Responsibilities Supervisors and managers have a responsibility to prevent sexual harassment and discrimination. All supervisors and managers who receive a complaint or information about suspected sexual harassment, observe what may be sexually harassing or discriminatory behavior, or for any reason suspect that sexual harassment or discrimination is occurring, are required to report the situation to the AVP, Talent Solutions, the Chief Talent Officer, any Chief level officer, or the President . Managers and supervisors should not be passive and wait for an employee to make a claim of harassment or discrimination. If they observe such behavior, they must act. Supervisors and managers can be disciplined if they engage in sexually harassing or discriminatory behavior themselves. Supervisors and managers can also be disciplined for failing to report suspected harassment or discrimination or allowing sexual harassment or discrimination to continue after they know about it. Supervisors and managers will also be subject to discipline for engaging in any retaliation or being aware of realiatory behavior and not correcting and reporting it. While supervisors and managers have a responsibility to report harassment and discrimination, supervisors and managers must be mindful of the impact that harassment and a subsequent investigation has on victims. Being identified as a possible victim of harassment and questioned about harassment and discrimination can be intimidating, uncomfortable and re-traumatizing for individuals. Supervisors and managers must accommodate the needs of individuals who have experienced harassment to ensure the workplace is safe, supportive, and free from retaliation for them during and after any investigation. Bystander Intervention Any employee witnessing harassment as a bystander is encouraged to report it. A supervisor or manager that is a bystander to harassment is required to report it. There are five standard methods of bystander intervention that can be used when anyone witnesses harassment or discrimination and wants to help. Specifically: 1. A bystander can interrupt the harassment by engaging with the individual being harassed and distracting them from the harassing behavior; 2. A bystander who feels unsafe interrupting on their own can ask a third party to help intervene in the harassment; 3. A bystander can record or take notes on the harassment incident to benefit a future investigation; 4. A bystander might check in with the person who has been harassed after the incident, see how they are feeling and let them know the behavior was not ok; and 5. If a bystander feels safe, they can confront the harassers and name the behavior as inappropriate. When confronting harassment, physically assaulting an individual is never an appropriate response. Though not exhaustive, and dependent on the circumstances, the guidelines above can serve as a brief guide of how to react when witnessing harassment in the workplace. Investigating Policy Violations All reported allegations of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation will be investigated promptly, and all involved parties, including supervisors and managers, are required to cooperate with that investigation. Confidentiality will be maintained throughout the investigatory process to the extent consistent with adequate investigation and appropriate corrective action. Investigations will be prompt and thorough, commenced immediately, and completed as soon as possible and will generally include: an immediate review of the allegations and, where appropriate, interim actions; obtaining, reviewing and preserving relevant documentation; interviewing all parties involved, including relevant witnesses; and documenting the investigation and its resolution and preserving such. The investigation will be completed and a determination regarding the reported harassment will be made and communicated in a timely manner to the individual(s) who reported the conduct, the subject(s) of the report, and the accused wrongdoer(s), though all details of the action(s) taken may not be disclosed. If AmeriCU determines that this policy has been violated, it will take effective remedial action commensurate with the circumstances. Any employee who has been found by AmeriCU to have harassed another employee will be subject to corrective action, up to and including discharge where appropriate. If it is concluded that a non-employee has subjected an employee or other person protected by this policy to conduct in violation of this policy, prompt and effective action will be taken to stop the harassment and deter any future harassment. Legal Protections and External Remedies Harassment is not only prohibited by AmeriCU but is also prohibited by state, federal, and, where applicable, local law. In addition to the procedures described in this policy, individuals may choose to pursue legal remedies with the following governmental entities. While a private attorney is not required to file a complaint with a governmental agency, you may also seek the legal advice of an attorney. New York State Division of Human Rights: The New York State Human Rights Law (HRL), N.Y. Executive Law, art. 15, \u00a7 290 _et seq._ , applies to all employers in New York State and protects employees and covered individuals, regardless of immigration status. A complaint alleging violation of the Human Rights Law may be filed either with the New York State Division of Human Rights (DHR) or in New York State Supreme Court. For claims arising prior to February 15, 2024, a complaint alleging a violation of the HRL may be filed either with DHR, subject to a one-year statute of limitations (three years for sexual harassment). For claims arising on or after February 14, 2024, a complaint may be filed with the DHR subject to a three-year statute of limitations. If an individual does not file a complaint with DHR, they can bring a lawsuit directly in state court under the Human Rights Law, within three years of the alleged sexual harassment. An individual may not file with DHR if they have already filed a HRL complaint in state court. Complaining internally to AmeriCU does not extend your time to file with DHR or in court. The three years are counted from the date of the most recent incident of harassment. DHR will investigate your complaint and determine whether there is probable cause to believe that sexual harassment has occurred. Probable cause cases receive a public hearing before an administrative law judge. If sexual harassment is found at the hearing, DHR has the power to award relief. Relief varies but it may include requiring your employer to take action to stop the harassment, or repair the damage caused by the harassment, including paying of monetary damages, punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees, and civil fines. DHR\u2019s main office contact information is: NYS Division of Human Rights, One Fordham Plaza, Fourth Floor, Bronx, New York 10458. You may call (718) 741-8400 or visit: www.dhr.ny.gov. Go to dhr.ny.gov/complaint for more information about filing a complaint with DHR. The website has a digital complaint process that can be completed on your computer or mobile device from start to finish. The website has a complaint form that can be downloaded, filled out, and mailed to DHR as well as a form that can be submitted online. The website also contains contact information for DHR\u2019s regional offices across New York State. Call the DHR sexual harassment hotline at 1(800) HARASS3 for more information about filing a sexual harassment complaint. This hotline can also provide you with a referral to a volunteer attorney experienced in sexual harassment matters who can provide you with limited free assistance and counsel over the phone. The United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission: The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces federal anti- discrimination laws, including Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act (codified as 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq.). An individual can file a complaint with the EEOC within 300 days from the most recent incident of harassment. There is no cost to file a complaint with the EEOC. The EEOC will investigate the complaint and determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that discrimination has occurred. If the EEOC determines that the law may have been violated, the EEOC will try to reach a voluntary settlement with the employer. If the EEOC cannot reach a settlement, the EEOC (or the Department of Justice in certain cases) will decide whether to file a lawsuit. The EEOC will issue a Notice of Right to Sue permitting workers to file a lawsuit in federal court if the EEOC closes the charge, is unable to determine if federal employment discrimination laws may have been violated or believes that unlawful discrimination occurred but does not file a lawsuit. Individuals may obtain relief in mediation, settlement or conciliation. In addition, federal courts may award remedies if discrimination is found to have occurred. In general, private employers must have at least 15 employees to come within the jurisdiction of the EEOC. An employee alleging discrimination at work can file a \u201cCharge of Discrimination.\u201d The EEOC has district, area, and field offices where complaints can be filed. Contact the EEOC by calling 1-800-669-4000 (TTY: 1-800-669-6820), visiting their website at www.eeoc.gov or via email at info@eeoc.gov. If an individual filed an administrative complaint with the New York State Division of Human Rights, DHR will automatically file the complaint with the EEOC to preserve the right to proceed in federal court. Many localities also enforce laws protecting individuals from sexual harassment and discrimination. An individual should contact the county, city or town in which they live to find out if such a law exists. If the harassment involves physical touching, coerced physical confinement or coerced sex acts, the conduct may constitute a crime, and it may be appropriate to report such conduct to the local police department. Local Protections Many localities enforce laws protecting individuals from sexual harassment and discrimination. An individual should contact the county, city or town in which they live to find out if such a law exists. Contact the Local Police Department If the harassment involves unwanted physical touching, coerced physical confinement, or coerced sex acts, the conduct may constitute a crime. Those wishing to pursue criminal charges are encouraged to contact their local police department. Liability Any employee who engages in prohibited harassment or discrimination, including any manager or supervisor who knew about the harassment or discrimination but took no action to stop it, may be held personally liable. The Credit Union does not consider conduct in violation of this policy to be within the course and scope of employment or the direct consequence of the discharge of one's duties. Accordingly, to the extent permitted by law, the Credit Union reserves the right not to provide a defense or pay damages assessed against employees for conduct in violation of this policy. REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH DECISION MAKING AmeriCU is committed to complying with the requirements of Section 203-e of the New York Labor Law, which protects employees on the basis of reproductive health decision making. For purposes of this policy, reproductive health decision making includes, but is not limited to, the decision to use or access a particular drug, device, or medical service. Access to Personal Information The Company will not access an employee\u2019s personal information regarding the employee\u2019s or the employee\u2019s dependent\u2019s reproductive health decision making, without prior informed affirmative written consent from the employee. Discrimination and Retaliation Discrimination and retaliation on the basis of an employee\u2019s or an employee\u2019s dependent\u2019s reproductive health decision making is unlawful. Employees have a right to be free from discrimination and retaliation with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of or on the basis of their own or their dependent\u2019s reproductive health decision making. For purposes of this policy, an act of retaliation includes discharge, suspension, demotion, or otherwise penalizing an employee for: (i) making or threatening to make a complaint to an employer, co-worker, or to a public body alleging a violation of their rights under this law; (ii) causing any proceeding under or related to this law to be instituted; or (iii) providing information to, or testifying before, any public body conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any such violation of a law, rule or regulation by AmeriCU. Waiver AmeriCU will not require employees to sign a waiver or any other document which purports to deny employees the right to make their own reproductive health care decisions. Remedies Employees who believe that their rights under this policy or the law have been violated are encouraged to make a report to Human Resources as soon as practicable. AmeriCU will promptly investigate any reports and take appropriate remedial action. Any employees who violate this policy, including supervisors and managers, will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination of employment. Employees may also bring a civil action alleging a violation of their rights and seek remedies (including, but not limited to, reinstatement, injunctive relief, back pay, benefits, attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, liquidated damages, etc.). CONSENSUAL RELATIONSHIPS AmeriCU discourages sexual or amorous relationships between employees. Such relationships may lead to charges of sexual harassment, morale problems, conflicts of interest, unprofessionalism or workplace distractions. Such relationships are particularly problematic when one employee in the relationship occupies a higher-level position within the organization than the other employee. Even when consensual, these asymmetrical relationships may result in favoritism or the perception of favoritism which imperils the integrity of the workplace. This is true even if the employees involved are not in a direct reporting line. Additionally, as a financial institution, AmeriCU is especially concerned about relationships which may lead to collusion or the opportunity to engage in collusion. In order to avoid these problems, AmeriCU requires the following: if a sexual, amorous or dating relationship is developing between employees, the employees involved must disclose the existence of the relationship to the Division Head or Human Resources. The failure to disclose promptly is a disciplinable offense. AmeriCU will determine what, if any, changes in reporting structure or other changes are necessary to preserve a professional work environment and the integrity of financial controls. Such changes may include one employee being reassigned to another position or location. If no changes are possible, one of the employees will be required to resign. CO-WORKER AND MEMBER RELATIONS AmeriCU expects its employees to deal with fellow associates, members and internal customers with professionalism and respect. Interact with members and internal customers in a polite and professional manner. Regard the member as the most important part of your job. Show respect for members and manage difficult or emotional customer situations. Respond promptly to member needs and requests for service and assistance. Treat fellow associates, members, and internal members with respect and consideration. Accept responsibility for your own actions. WORKPLACE VIOLENCE It is the intent of AmeriCU to provide a safe work environment. Our intent is to minimize the risk of personal injury at our facilities and reduce the risk of damage to Credit Union property. We believe we can minimize and/or eliminate potential problems if we can identify stressors and situations in the workplace early. Perceived threats, threatening language, intimidating behavior or any other acts of aggression or violence by anyone against anyone including an employee, member, business partner, and/or the Credit Union will not be tolerated. A perceived threat is an act attempting to intimidate or instill fear in others, including, but not limited to the following: Any form of verbal harassment or abuse ( _i.e._ , threatening, menacing, or obscene conversations, phone calls, gestures, emails or texts); Any form of physical violence or abuse (includes bodily harm such as striking, punching, etc.); Flashing of weapons, threatening to bring a weapon to work, or other intimidating conversation about weapons within the work environment; Stalking (such as following to and from work, observing from a distance which causes the employee to become uncomfortable and/or intimidated, etc.); Aggressive, injurious and destructive actions undertaken for the purpose of domination or intimidation; Destroying or threatening to destroy personal property of a member or employee; and Destroying or threatening to destroy Credit Union property. Reports of workplace violence or threats may be made anonymously to your supervisor or the Human Resources Department. Workplace violence complaints or concerns may also be reported confidentially using our _Report It_ procedure outlined below in the Whistleblower Policy below. An employee who has committed any of these infractions will be subject to discipline, up to and including immediate termination of employment and possible criminal prosecution. Employees who report a threat in good faith will not be subject to retaliation, intimidation or discipline. WORKPLACE ACCOMMODATIONS AmeriCU will comply with all laws concerning the employment of individuals with known disabilities (including pregnancy and related medical conditions). The Credit Union will attempt to provide such qualified individuals with reasonable accommodation(s) necessary to perform the essential functions of the job, unless doing so would create an undue hardship on the Practice or pose a direct safety threat. We will not discriminate against qualified individuals with known disabilities in regard to application procedures, hiring, advancement, termination of employment, compensation, training or other terms, conditions and privileges of employment. The Credit Union also complies with all applicable laws, including the Pregnancy Discrimination Act and the Pregnant Workers\u2019 Fairness Act (PWFA), regarding reasonable accommodations needed for pregnancy, having a child, or medical conditions related to pregnancy. Accordingly, the Credit Union will engage in the interactive process and make reasonable accommodations to known limitations related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions for qualified employees or applicants, unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the Credit Union. Examples of pregnancy-related accommodations for consideration could include providing frequent bathroom breaks and rest breaks, assistance with manual labor or lifting items, leave of absence, and breaks to express milk. The Credit Union will not require covered employees covered by the PWFA to take paid or unpaid leave if another reasonable accommodation is available. The Credit Union will endeavor to accommodate sincerely held religious beliefs of employees to the extent such accommodation does not impose an undue hardship on the Credit Union\u2019s operations. Employees with a disability or who otherwise require an accommodation under this policy should contact Human Resources to request an accommodation. Upon receipt of a request for accommodation, the Human Resources Department will engage in a cooperative dialogue and/or interactive process with the applicant or employee to determine how the individual may be accommodated. Accommodations will not be provided if they impose an undue hardship on the Credit Union. If a particular accommodation imposes an undue hardship, the Credit Union will consider whether there are alternative accommodations that would not impose such hardship. The Credit Union may request the employee provide documentation from a health care professional in order to evaluate the accommodation request. Any medical information received will be maintained as confidential in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The Credit Union will not tolerate discrimination or retaliation against an individual with a known disability, or for requesting or receiving a reasonable accommodation in accordance with this policy and as protected under applicable laws. Any concerns regarding discrimination or retaliation in violation of this policy should be promptly reported to Human Resources. WHISTLEBLOWER POLICY AmeriCU\u2019s Code of Ethics requires its Board of Directors, officers, agents, members and employees at every level to observe high standards of business ethics in the conduct of their duties. As employees and representatives of the Credit Union, we must practice honesty and integrity in fulfilling our responsibilities and complying with all applicable laws and regulations AmeriCU\u2019s Whistleblower Policy is intended to encourage and enable employees and others listed above to raise serious concerns within the Credit Union prior to seeking outside resolution. No member of the Board of Directors, officer, agent, member or employee at any level who in good faith reports a violation shall suffer any form of retaliation. An employee at any level who retaliates against someone who has reported a violation in good faith will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. AmeriCU endorses the importance of recognizing and addressing concerns and complaints promptly. Suggested steps are: Have an immediate discussion with your supervisor if appropriate. Write down your complaint or concern and submit it to your immediate supervisor. If you are not comfortable submitting your complaint to your immediate supervisor, you may submit it to your Senior Manager. If your problem cannot be resolved by your immediate supervisor and/or Senior Manager, or you do not feel comfortable reporting to those individuals, it may be brought to the attention of AVP, Talent Solutions who will attempt to lead the parties to resolution of the problem. If no resolution can be made, the complaint may be brought to the attention of the Chief Talent Officer. _Report It_ Option Complaints or concerns may also be reported confidentially using our _Report It_ procedure. _Report it_ is a third-party anonymous and confidential hotline for reporting illegal or unethical actions.

Other forms of contact include, the NCUA\u2019s Fraud Hotline at 800-827-9650, as well as the Credit Union\u2019s Chairman of the Supervisory Committee, glenng@americu.org. ALCOHOL AND DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE AmeriCU is concerned about the health and safety of its workforce and committed to providing employees with a work environment that is free of the problems associated with illegal or improper use, transfer or possession of drugs and alcohol. Because AmeriCU recognizes that drug and alcohol abuse in the workplace presents a danger to our employees, the Credit Union, and its members, and in response to federal requirements, it is the policy of the Company to create a drug-free workplace in compliance with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988. The Drug-Free Workplace Act specifically requires the Credit Union to notify each employee that, as a condition of employment, each employee must: Comply with the Credit Union\u2019s Drug-Free Workplace Policy; and Notify the Credit Union of any conviction for a drug-related offense in the workplace within five (5) days of the conviction. As required, a report will be made to the appropriate contracting or granting agency in a timely manner. The Credit Union prohibits: the unlawful use, manufacture, distribution, dispensation, transfer, possession, or sale of a controlled substance, other illegal substance, and/or cannabis (marijuana) in the workplace, on AmeriCU property (including the parking area), or while engaged in AmeriCU business off the Credit Union\u2019s premises is strictly prohibited. Such conduct is also prohibited during non-working time to the extent it impairs an employee\u2019s ability to perform their job. unauthorized consumption of alcohol during working time or during breaks or meal periods; reporting to work under the influence of alcohol, marijuana or other cannabis product, or illegal drugs; unauthorized possession of alcoholic beverages on Credit Union at work; driving a Credit Union vehicle or a personal vehicle on Credit Union business while under the influence of alcohol or an illegal drug, marijuana or other cannabis product, intoxicant, or controlled substance; and violating any Credit Union rule or policy regarding alcohol and drug use. NOTE: Occasionally, alcohol is served at social events sponsored by the Credit Union. Alcohol may be served at these events only with the approval of the President-CEO. Only moderate and limited use of alcohol is acceptable. Employees are expected to remain responsible, professional, and sober at all times. AmeriCU also encourages employees to voluntarily seek help with drug and alcohol related conditions. AmeriCU offers employees a confidential Employee Assistance Program (EAP) through an outside service at no cost to employees. Additional information regarding the EAP can be found in the Employee Assistance Program policy below. Contact information regarding the EAP can be found in the Knowledge Base on the intranet. At the same time, a voluntary request for assistance will not protect an employee from termination or discipline where that employee has violated this or any other Credit Union policy. The Credit Union complies with all standards as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act and the New York Human Rights Law and protects and makes reasonable accommodations for alcoholics and recovered and recovering drug addicts who are not currently using. In addition, employees may not report for duty while under the influence of alcohol. Employees may not consume alcohol on AmeriCU property or while on duty in the employment of AmeriCU. To ensure compliance with this policy, substance abuse screening may be conducted where there is reasonable suspicion that an employee is under the influence of alcohol or drugs, including cannabis (marijuana), that could affect or has adversely affected the employee\u2019s job performance or the safety of the employee or others. Employees should immediately report any suspected violations of this policy to their immediate supervisor or to the Human Resources. Employees who violate any aspect of this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. In accordance with applicable law, the Credit Union will not discriminate against, terminate, discipline, or refuse to hire or employ individuals solely because they lawfully use and/or possess marijuana or other cannabis products off-duty, off Credit Union premises and are not under the influence while on- duty. If an employee is impaired by the legal use of marijuana or other cannabis products interfering with the employee\u2019s performance of their job duties or with the Credit Union\u2019s obligation to provide a safe and healthy workplace, the Credit Union may remove the employee from work and/or Credit Union property and/or discipline the employee, up to and including termination of employment. Determinations of impairment will be made by a supervisor or a member of management, in accordance with applicable law. Nothing in this policy requires the Credit Union to commit any act that would cause it to be in violation of federal law, or which would result in the loss of a federal contract or federal funding. Moreover, nothing in this policy prohibits or limits the Credit Union from taking action as required by state or federal statute, regulation, ordinance, or other governmental mandate. Nothing in this policy precludes the appropriate use of legally prescribed medications so long as the use is lawful, does not impair your ability to perform your job and does not present a direct threat to the safety of the employee or others. CONFIDENTIALITY In the course of your work, you will have access to Confidential Information regarding the Credit Union, its members, business partners and your fellow employees. Confidential Information is defined to include the affairs of our members and confidential business information, such as marketing plans and strategies, pricing information, or other non-public proprietary information. This Confidential Information must be held in the strictest confidence. Under no circumstances should you discuss Confidential Information with your friends, relatives, or anyone else outside the Credit Union. Internal discussions about Confidential Information should only be on a need-to-know basis. Do not disclose any member information. Be particularly careful to protect member Social Security numbers, account numbers or any other identifying information. The Credit Union\u2019s reputation can be seriously damaged by the careless handling of the Confidential Information that we possess, and the Credit Union may be subject to a lawsuit if the disclosures are of a serious nature. Any disclosure of Confidential Information may be grounds for immediate termination of employment. Please check with your supervisor if you have any questions regarding what information may be permissible revealed. REQUESTS FOR EMPLOYEE INFORMATION Prospective employers, financial institutions, residential property managers, and state and federal agencies routinely contact the Credit Union to obtain information about the employment history of former and current employees. Employees should not respond to these requests. All such requests must be referred immediately to the Human Resources Department. CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS All public Credit Union communications, media releases, statements, advertising, photographs, video and so forth must be cleared in advance with the Marketing Division. Unless expressly designated to speak on the Credit Union\u2019s behalf, you may not represent your views as the views of the Credit Union. Events may occur at the Credit Union that will draw immediate attention from the news media. It is imperative that one person speaks for the Credit Union to deliver an appropriate message and to avoid giving misinformation in any media inquiry. Accordingly, employees are required to answer all media questions as follows: \u201cI am not authorized to comment for the Credit Union. Let me have our Marketing Division contact you.\u201d The media includes such things as television, newspapers, radio, Internet, trade journals, magazines, etc. EMPLOYEE DELINQUENCY AmeriCU employees, as employees of a financial institution, are expected to uphold their personal financial obligations. AmeriCU has put faith in its employees to handle the membership\u2019s financial well-being; therefore, AmeriCU requires employees to take the same care to ensure their own accounts are in good standing. Employee accounts will be monitored in the same manner as member accounts. TRAINING AND PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT ORIENTATION PERIOD The first ninety (90) days of an individual\u2019s employment will be considered an orientation period during which the employee will have the opportunity to learn the assigned duties and to be evaluated on their capability to perform those duties. It is also a time for the employee and AmeriCU to evaluate continuing the employment relationship. During the 90-day period, employees will be reviewed on their progress. Further training may be recommended for an employee at their supervisor\u2019s request. The orientation can be shortened or lengthened as deemed appropriate by management. However, if it becomes apparent the employee is not suited for employment with AmeriCU as determined by AmeriCU, the employee may be terminated from employment without advance notice at any time during the orientation period. Likewise, if a new employee decides not to work for the Credit Union, they may resign without advance notice at any time during the orientation period. Employees are frequently expected to participate in training during their employment with AmeriCU. This is an important element in maintaining quality service to our members. Successful completion of the orientation period does not guarantee continued employment. Even after the orientation period is over, employment remains at- will. PERFORMANCE REVIEWS All employees will be rated on performance by their immediate supervisor upon completion of the ninety (90) day orientation period. Your supervisor regularly monitors your performance and may talk with you about it whenever necessary. At any time if you are not sure how you are doing, or have questions or concerns about your performance, please talk to your supervisor. Frequent informal communication between you and your supervisor is essential, as open communication improves the quality of our individual and group efforts. Formal performance reviews occur, at a minimum, on an annual basis. The purpose of the formal review is to evaluate performance by: Providing an objective means of appraising abilities and performance. Identifying strong and weak points and setting goals which address them. Establishing eligibility for advancement. Creating an employee development plan. A successful performance evaluation does not automatically result in a pay increase, nor does it guarantee continued employment. INTERNAL JOB TRANSFERS Job openings are typically placed on the Credit Union\u2019s intranet simultaneously with posting externally. Once a job is posted to the intranet, employees can submit their interest in the position via the electronic _Internal Job Application_. All internal applications received will be considered with external candidates. Employees may apply for any job for which they are qualified. Employees can apply to and from any position or level. Accepting a job at a lower pay grade may result in a decrease in pay. Part-time employees may qualify for a full-time position within their same position after a minimum of 90 days of employment. Employees meeting the requirements are eligible to apply for a different position if their most recent performance review rating was \u201cMeets Expectations\u201d or greater. Employees may be prohibited from applying to an internal position if they have any documented performance deficiencies, have violated AmeriCU policies/procedures or have failed to meet MVP professional standards. These may be documented in a corrective action notice for example or in an annual performance review. If an employee is uncertain of their performance status, they should contact Human Resources before applying. An employee who has been new hired or has been successfully awarded an internal transfer into another position is not eligible to apply for another transfer for six (6 months) at the staff level and one (1) year at a manager and higher level. Exceptions to these guidelines may be authorized by the Assistant Vice President, Talent Solutions. Qualified candidates will be interviewed by the Department or Financial Center Manager in charge of the position. A candidate may not be interviewed if they do not meet the minimum qualifications for the position or the hiring manager recently interviewed the same candidate for the same or similar position. Selection will be made based on qualifications, suitability to the vacant job, and ability to train the candidate. While we give due consideration to internal applicants, AmeriCU reserves the right to fill open positions with external candidates. AmeriCU also reserves the right to hire an external candidate without posting internally. EMPLOYEE REFERRAL PROGRAM To enhance our current recruiting and hiring processes, you may want to consider assisting us in finding new qualified people to work at AmeriCU. If you know someone who would be a great fit at AmeriCU, we look forward to your referral. You can earn $150 for a non-exempt (hourly) referral and $500 for an exempt (salaried) referral. To receive referral money, the following conditions must be met: The referring employee must complete an Employee Referral Form located in the Knowledge Base area of the intranet and submit it to Human Resources. The Employee Referral Form must be received by the AVP, Talent Solutions prior to receiving the referral's employment application. The referral may be considered after the applicant has applied if they listed the employee\u2019s name on their employment application. The referred applicant must be formally hired for a regular position with the Credit Union. Temporary status positions do not qualify for this program. The referred employee must successfully complete their ninety (90) day orientation period. Referrals are valid for one (1) year from receipt by Human Resources. The employee referral program is only for referring new candidates from outside the Credit Union. EMPLOYEE MEMBERSHIP IN OUTSIDE ORGANIZATIONS Employees are encouraged to become members and actively participate in professional societies, service clubs, trade associations, community organizations, etc. The Credit Union may reimburse employees for the cost of membership in an outside professional organization. To be considered for reimbursement the membership must: Improve the employee's training, performance or education at the Credit Union; Enhance the Credit Union's image in the community; and Not be a conflict of interest with Credit Union business. AmeriCU reserves the right to determine whether, in its sole discretion, membership in an organization will be reimbursed. Employees who wish to be considered for reimbursement should contact Human Resources. WORKING CONDITIONS AND EXPECTATIONS ATTENDANCE AND PUNCTUALITY Your punctuality and regular attendance are expected and essential for efficient operations. If you know in advance you are going to be late or absent, you must notify your immediate supervisor as soon as possible, but no later than one (1) hour prior to your appointed starting time. However, when using personal time for reasons that qualify under the New York State Paid Sick Leave Law, notice must simply be provided prior to your appointed starting time. Every job at the Credit Union is important and arrangements must be made for someone to monitor your area of responsibility if you are not at work when expected. Continual absences reduce your effectiveness on the job. Attendance and punctuality are important factors in determining your overall job performance. If you are absent from work for three (3) days and have not called in your absences to your immediate supervisor, you will be considered to have voluntarily terminated and your employment will be ended. If you are out of work for three (3) or more days due to illness, a doctor\u2019s note certifying your fitness to return to work will be required upon your return (unless you are on an approved leave, _e.g._ , FMLA). Excessive absenteeism or tardiness that is not otherwise excused under this Attendance Policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Other continuing patterns of absences, early departures, or tardiness\u2014regardless of the exact number of days\u2014may also warrant disciplinary action. The Credit Union will not discipline an employee for absences related to the following: Approved NYS Paid Sick Leave, NYS Paid Family Leave, or FMLA; Absence provided as reasonable accommodation of known disabilities, sincerely held religious practice or belief, or status as a victim of domestic violence; Requested and approved time off prior to being scheduled to work; or Any other legally protected absence. EMPLOYMENT STATUS In order to determine eligibility for benefits and overtime, and to ensure compliance with federal and state laws and regulations, AmeriCU classifies its employees as shown below. AmeriCU may review or change the classifications at any time. Full-time employees have a regularly scheduled work week of at least forty (40) hours, not including meal periods. Part-time employees normally work less than forty (40) hours per week. They are further classified according to the following three categories for benefit purposes: under 20 hours, 20 to 29 hours, and 30 to 39 hours. Temporary employees are hired to work for a short, specified period of time to assist AmeriCU in meeting short-term business needs. The number of hours they work may vary. Temporary employees are not eligible for any Credit Union benefits except where required by state and federal law. Employees will also be classified as exempt or non-exempt. Non-exempt employees are eligible for minimum wage and overtime as set forth by federal and/or state wage and hour laws. Non-exempt employees are entitled to overtime premium pay at a rate of one and one-half times their regular rate for all hours worked in excess of 40 per workweek. Exempt employees are those whose job assignments meet the federal and state requirements for overtime exemption. Exempt employees are compensated on a salary basis, which is intended to pay for all hours worked during each work week, regardless of the employee\u2019s actual hours worked or schedule, and are not eligible for overtime pay. HOURS OF WORK For pay purposes, the administrative work week for the Credit Union is Sunday 12:00 AM through Saturday 11: 59 PM. The actual hours scheduled for various positions may differ in order to best serve our membership and maximize efficiency of operations. Your supervisor will inform you of your particular schedule. SATURDAY WORK SCHEDULE Some financial centers schedule certain employees to work a six (6) day, forty (40) hour week, including Saturdays. At other locations, you will be expected to work on Saturday from time-to-time. The Saturday work schedule is distributed in advance for planning purposes. OVERTIME AmeriCU pays overtime according to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and applicable state law. Non-exempt employees will receive one and one-half times their regular rate of pay for hours worked over 40 hours in a work week. Overtime pay is based on hours worked per single work week (Sunday 12: 00 AM \u2013 Saturday 11: 59 PM). Overtime is not calculated per day or averaged over several weeks. Only hours worked count toward overtime. Any paid time off, such as holiday, PTO, jury and administrative leave, does not count toward hours worked even if employees are paid for this time. Exempt employees are paid a salary that is intended as compensation for all hours worked, no matter the number. Therefore, exempt employees are not eligible for overtime pay. All overtime work for non-exempt employees must be authorized in advance by their supervisor. Working overtime without prior authorization may result in disciplinary action. In addition, employees will not be paid regular wages or overtime for attending the following events when the events occur outside the employees\u2019 normal working hours and attendance is not explicitly required by the employee\u2019s Manager: Attendance at receptions, dinners, or social gatherings. Volunteer time at a Company event (unless employees are expressly informed that this will be a working event; such events are often organized by Marketing); Attendance at social events or sporting events (i.e., a golf tournament or Company-sponsored Road race); Attendance at non-AmeriCU Board Meetings or Board events; and Attendance at AmeriCU\u2019s annual Board Meeting (unless the employees are working the event or have been expressly notified by their Manager that attendance is required). MEAL PERIOD(S) AND BREAKS It is the supervisor\u2019s responsibility to schedule lunch and breaks. If employees need to change their normal lunch or break time, they are required to notify their supervisor well in advance so coverage can be planned; if they do not provide advance notice, the change request may be denied. Meal periods are unpaid. Employees are free to leave the Credit Union premises during any unpaid meal periods. Meal Periods \u2013 Employees are permitted thirty (30) or sixty (60) minutes for meal period depending upon their department, schedule or financial center requirements. When employees are scheduled to work at least six (6) hours, they are required to take at least a thirty-minute meal period and are required to punch out and back in from lunch. Working through lunch is prohibited. If you do not take a scheduled meal break for any reason, you must notify your supervisor and your immediate supervisor as soon as possible so that alternative arrangements can be made. Employees may not work through their meal breaks or skip meal breaks to leave work early. Failure to consistently punch in and out for lunches and other time away from work will result in corrective action. Breaks \u2013 When possible, employees will be given a break in the morning and in the afternoon. Occasionally, the workload and staffing levels will prohibit the allowance of breaks. Extending a rest period beyond the allotted time period is a violation of this policy that will result in disciplinary action. In addition, unauthorized extensions of rest periods will not be counted as hours worked and may be unpaid. NURSING MOTHERS Women returning to work following the birth of a child may require breaks in a private area for the purpose of expressing breast milk. Break periods for breast milk expression are paid break periods during the first three years of each child\u2019s life. During each such three-year period, AmeriCU will provide 30 minutes of paid break time each time such employee has reasonable need to express breast milk. An employee may also use existing break time or mealtime to express breast milk, at the employee\u2019s option. An employee may be required to postpone a scheduled breast milk expression break for up to thirty minutes if appropriate coverage is not available. Prior to returning from parental leave, the Credit Union will send a copy of this policy to the employee (either electronically, by mail to the employee\u2019s last known address, or both). If an employee wants to express breast milk at work, the employee must provide Human Resources reasonable advance notice, generally before returning to the workplace if the employee is on leave. This advance notice is to allow us the time to find an appropriate location and adjust schedules if needed. An employee who wishes to request a room or other location to express breast milk in the workplace should do so by submitting a verbal or written request to their manager. We will respond to this request in writing within five (5) days. A private space or alternative location will be made available to all employees for this purpose. The room will be close to the employee\u2019s work area, provide good lighting, be private, have clean running water available nearby, have an electrical outlet (if the workplace is supplied with electricity), and will include a chair and a desk, small table, counter, or other flat surface. However, separate spaces are not required for every nursing employee. An employee also may use the common refrigerator on the premises to store breast milk. The employee is required to store all expressed milk in closed containers and bring milk home each evening. We are not responsible for ensuring the safekeeping of expressed milk stored in any refrigerator in the workplace. AmeriCU strives to be a \u201cfamily friendly\u201d workplace; however, in the interest of running our business professionally, this policy does not authorize the presence of children in the workplace for the purpose of breastfeeding. An employee will not be retaliated or discriminated against if she chooses to express breast milk pursuant to this policy. Any employee who believes she has experienced discrimination, or retaliation should notify Human Resources. DRESS CODE POLICY Employee appearance contributes to AmeriCU\u2019s culture and reputation. Employees are expected to present themselves in a professional manner that results in a favorable impression to our internal and external members. As part of that effort, AmeriCU expects employees to dress for their day. This means if you have sales meetings, vendor meetings, etc. that you will dress in a professional manner appropriate for those meetings. Managers/Supervisors may exercise reasonable discretion to determine appropriateness in employee dress and appearance. They are responsible for communicating any department-specific workplace attire and grooming guidelines to staff members. It is impossible to maintain the dress policy to keep up with changing fashion trends. We expect employees to use mature judgment and report to work in neatly ironed, professional attire including good personal hygiene. It is important to remember that members, guests and vendors base their opinion of our service, in part, on the image we portray. Mondays through Thursdays are designated as _Business Professional_ attire days. The following are acceptable: professional AmeriCU apparel (preferred); dresses or skirts; tailored or dress slacks; blouses; sweaters; blazers; collared dress shirts; suit jackets; sport jacket; dress shoes or flats. Fridays and Saturdays and remote work are designated as _Business Casual Attire_. Business casual attire means clothing that is comfortable at work, yet appropriate for an office environment. Professional shirts with AmeriCU logo (strongly encouraged and preferred); polo, oxford and turtleneck shirts; sweaters; vests; jeans (with no holes, rips, or excessive fading); khakis or docker slacks; capris or gaucho pants; sneakers in excellent condition (not overly worn or dirty); loafers; flats; dress sandals or dress boots. Unacceptable attire includes, but is not limited to: tee shirts, flip flops, sweatpants, sweatshirts, leggings or workout attire; skirts more than 3\u201d above the knee; sleeveless shirts with straps less than three fingers in width; political or inappropriate slogans on apparel; visible tattoos that are lewd (offensive in nature) or excessive (covering the majority of exposed skin) \u2013 such tattoos must be covered at all times in the office; clothes that are too tight, too small, sheer or clothing that otherwise is revealing, distracting or provocative; and clothing with any rips, tears or frays, or any extreme style or fashion in dress, foot ware, accessories or fragrances. Employees will be sent home to make appropriate changes if their personal appearance or dress is deemed unacceptable or for poor hygiene. Additionally, they may be subject to corrective action and nonexempt employees will not be paid for that time away. AmeriCU recognizes the importance of individually held religious beliefs to persons within its workforce and will reasonably accommodate a staff member\u2019s religious beliefs in terms of workplace attire unless the accommodation creates an undue hardship. An employee who wants to request a workplace attire accommodation based on religious beliefs should contact the AVP, Talent Solutions. Nothing in this policy is intended to prohibit employees from wearing natural hairstyles, such as braids, locks and twists, or to otherwise discriminate against a particular racial group because of traits historically associated with race. PERSONAL CALLS AND TEXTING While at work, employees are expected to exercise the same discretion in using personal cellular phones and technology (texting, smart phones, etc.) as is expected with the use of Credit Union phones. Personal phone calls and texts by employees are to be made during lunch or break times, unless it is an emergency. Keep personal calls on Credit Union phones brief and only when absolutely necessary. Due to the potential for issues such as invasion of privacy (employee and member), sexual or other harassment (as defined by the Credit Union\u2019s Harassment and Sexual Harassment Prevention policies), and protection of other proprietary information, employees may not take, distribute or post pictures, videos or audio recordings while on working time. Employees may also not take pictures or make recordings of work areas. An exception to this rule would be to engage in activity protected by the National Labor Relations Act including, for example, taking pictures of health, safety and/or working condition concerns or of strike, protest and work-related issues and/or other protected concerted activities. CELL PHONE USAGE We recognize that cell phones (and smartphones especially) have become an integral part of everyday life. They may be a great asset if used correctly (for productivity apps, calendars, etc.). But cell phones may also cause problems when used imprudently or excessively. Despite their benefits, personal cell phones may cause problems in the workplace. Employees who use their cell phones excessively typically get distracted from their work, disturb colleagues and cause security issues from inappropriate use of AmeriCU-issued equipment or misuse of AmeriCU\u2019s internet connection. Employees are prohibited from: Having cell phones out in sight of our members or near the Instant-Issue machines. Playing games or using the internet on their cell phone during working hours. Using their cell phone\u2019s camera or microphone to record confidential information. Speaking on their phones within earshot of colleagues\u2019 working space during working hours. Employees are allowed to use their phones to occasionally send or check important messages and to make limited, brief personal calls away from the working space of colleagues, as long as their use of their cell phone does not interfere with their work, the work of others or service to AmeriCU\u2019s members. Employees can also use their phones during a dedicated break time or at lunch. Employees must turn off or silence their phones when asked. AmeriCU retains the right to monitor employees for excessive or inappropriate use of their cell phones. If an employee\u2019s cell phone usage causes a decline in productivity or interferes with our operations, we have the right to ban that employee from using their cell phone and/or impose disciplinary action, up to and including termination. OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT AmeriCU prohibits outside employment (including self-employment) that conflicts with employment at AmeriCU, impacts the employee\u2019s work performance or schedule, and/or affects the business interests of AmeriCU. Employees must contact Human Resources to obtain approval prior to engaging in any outside employment. If AmeriCU determines that an employee\u2019s outside work interferes with performance or the ability to meet the requirements of employment at the Credit Union, the employee may be asked to terminate the outside employment if he/she wishes to remain employed with AmeriCU. EMPLOYMENT OF RELATIVES The employment of family members can cause conflicts of interest and negatively impact our culture. AmeriCU believes in hiring and promoting people based on their knowledge, skills, abilities, and potential. As such, we wish to reduce the potential conflicts of interest that can occur when family members work together. No family members shall: Work in the same department, financial center or share a direct supervisory relationship. These restrictions apply: When a relative of an employee or official is hired When an employee who is a relative of an employee or official is transferred within the organization When existing employees become relatives \u2013 If a new relationship violates this policy (for example, a new romantic relationship, a family marriage that creates an aunt/uncle/niece/ nephew relationship), you are required to report the change or potential change to Human Resources immediately. Human Resources will work with you, your family member, and your manager(s) to find a solution (if available) that doesn\u2019t violate this policy. AmeriCU reserves the right to reassign one or both employees to an available position for which the employee is qualified. If no such position is available, one of the employees may be asked to leave AmeriCU\u2019s employ. This policy will be applied in accordance with applicable state and federal laws. Any employee who violates this policy will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination of employment. Potential conflicts of interest not specifically noted above will be addressed and corrected by AmeriCU in the best interest of the Credit Union. Questions or comments about this topic and its application may be addressed to Human Resources. CHILDREN IN THE WORKPLACE The presence of children in the workplace with the employee (as the parent or guardian) during the workday should be avoided except in emergency situations. This is necessary to avoid disruptions in job duties of the employee and fellow co-workers, reduce liability and maintain a professional work environment. A child brought into the workplace in an unavoidable situation will be the responsibility of the employee. They must be accompanied by and under the direct supervision of the employee parent/guardian at all times. Further, an employee intending to bring a child to work must have advance permission of their supervisor. CORRECTIVE ACTION AND DISCIPLINE PROCEDURE Disciplinary action for violations of Credit Union rules, policies and substandard performance may be taken in any of the following forms: Verbal warning Written warning Suspension without pay Termination of employment without notice Demotion and reduction in pay Performance Improvement Plan While the Credit Union does not have a formal progressive discipline policy, the Credit Union may generally take disciplinary action in a progressive manner ( _i.e._ , verbal warning, written warning, suspension without pay, and termination of employment). However, the Credit Union reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to decide whether and what disciplinary action will be taken in any given situation. For example, a situation may warrant an immediate termination of employment rather than following a progressive path of disciplinary action. All steps will be coordinated in collaboration with Human Resources and must be documented in the employee\u2019s personnel file. Although an exhaustive list is impossible, the following are examples of infractions which could lead to discipline, up to and including immediate termination of employment: Performing any type of transaction or file maintenance on your own or a family member\u2019s account; or any other account where there might be a potential conflict of interest; Failure to work in a cooperative manner with management/supervision, fellow associates, members, and internal customers; Rude, obscene or discourteous behavior toward fellow associates or members; Verbal arguments or fighting; Failure to execute job assignments; Failure to follow policies or procedures; Failure to cooperate fully in Credit Union investigations; Chronic absenteeism when proper notice and approvals have not been granted; Continued abuse of personal leave privileges such as chronic absenteeism and habitually calling in sick on Fridays or Mondays; Drinking alcoholic beverage(s) during work hours and/or being intoxicated at work; Possession, sale, distribution and/or use of illegal drugs or cannabis (marijuana) on Credit Union premises or during work hours; Stealing, misappropriating or intentionally damaging property belonging to the Credit Union, its employees or members; Divulging any Confidential Information except as permitted by state or federal law Continued interference with work performance of other employees; Falsification of Credit Union records such as, but not limited to, employment applications, payroll information, and work documents; Sexual or other harassment or discrimination and/or creating a toxic or hostile work environment; Causing a loss to the Credit Union by means of fraudulent or grossly negligent actions; Clocking in or out for others via the time and attendance system, having someone clock in or out for you, or otherwise falsifying time records; Possessing a handgun, firearm, knife, or other weapon of any kind on your person or belongings while on Credit Union property; Other such reasons which may adversely affect the efficient operation of Credit Union and service to our members; Knowingly providing false or misleading information to the Credit Union, including but not limited to complaints, reports or in the context of workplace investigations; Failure to disclose a possible conflict of interest as soon as possible; Failure to disclose a relationship which is covered by the Code of Ethics/Conflict of Interest policy, Consensual Relationships policy, and/or Employment of Relatives policy; and Failure to obtain a proper signature (or documented authorization if signature is not obtained) for all transactions and file maintenance on member and employee accounts or asking a colleague to perform transactions or file maintenance outside of this policy. Failure to maintain expected levels of safety within your department, placing your co-workers/team at risk. Engaging in dangerous or disruptive activity in the workplace, including using obscene, abusive or threatening language or gestures. Engaging in inappropriate and/or unprofessional conduct while on company time or property or in the course of or related to one\u2019s employment. Please note that it would be impossible to create policies covering any and all inappropriate workplace behaviors in this handbook. However, even absent a specific policy, management reserves the right to address workplace behaviors it deems inappropriate. Employees who are not in good standing, for example, on a performance improvement or a corrective action plan, will not be eligible to participate in certain activities as outlined in each particular handbook section. Employees must report any suspected violations of any Credit Union policies and any unethical, unprofessional or dishonest behavior to their immediate supervisor or Human Resources. The Credit Union may investigate such reports, and employees must cooperate with such investigations. It is the Credit Union\u2019s policy and intention to apply these rules in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including the National Labor Relations Act and the federal and New York discrimination laws. SOLICITATION AND DISTRIBUTION AmeriCU recognizes that many organizations provide valuable services and benefits to their communities. AmeriCU also recognizes it has a responsibility to maintain employee productivity and ensure that employees are not pressured to support causes. From time to time, AmeriCU may sponsor fund raising activities for selected charities or organizations. Employees may decide to contribute to these charities, but this is entirely optional. Employees are not permitted to engage in or solicit for personal money-making activities ( _e.g._ , Avon, MaryKay, Amway, or any side business) during their work hours or during the work hours of the co-worker(s) at whom the activity is directed, nor may they use AmeriCU equipment or resources to do so ( _e.g._ , AmeriCU\u2019s email system, phones, and so on). Employees may post charitable information on the electronic bulletin board, per the Intranet and Bulletin Board Posting Procedure. Employees must seek their manager\u2019s permission before posting any item. AmeriCU will deny permission if the posting is inconsistent with this policy, potentially disruptive, or otherwise inappropriate for the workplace. Employees may not solicit or promote support for any cause or distribute literature or printed materials during their working time. Employees who are not on working time ( _e.g._ , those on lunch hour or breaks) may not solicit employees who are on working time for any cause or distribute literature of any kind to them. Furthermore, employees may not distribute literature or printed material of any kind in working areas ( _e.g._ , offices, call center, lobby areas) at any time. AmeriCU does not allow non-employees to solicit employees or other persons on AmeriCU\u2019s property or distribute written material for any purpose on AmeriCU\u2019s property. As used in this policy, \u201cworking time\u201d includes all time for which an employee is paid and/or is scheduled to be performing services for AmeriCU; it does not include break periods, meal periods, or periods in which an employee is not, and is not scheduled to be, performing services or work for AmeriCU. SAFETY AND FACILITIES GENERAL SAFETY GUIDELINES AmeriCU is concerned about the safety, health and well-being of our employees, members and visitors. We strive to ensure a safe place to work by providing safe equipment, proper training and safe methods and procedures. The following is a list of general safety guidelines we expect each employee to follow: Learn the location of all fire exits and extinguishers. Report to work in good mental and physical condition so you can safely perform your job. Keep your work area in a clean, safe and orderly condition. Remove boxes, clutter and trip hazards from walkways. Use proper lifting techniques \u2013 \u201clift with your knees not with your back\u201d. Keep storage cabinets closed when not attended. When traveling on Credit Union business obey all traffic laws. Employees who drive as part of their job duties cannot use portable electronic devices while driving to view, take, or transmit images; to play games; to browse the internet; to talk (where possible); or to compose, send, read, view, access, browse, transmit, save, or retrieve e-mail, text messages or other electronic data. Portable electronic devices include hand-held mobile telephones, hand-held devices with mobile data access, iPads, tablets, laptop computers or other portable computing devices, pagers, electronic games, and broadband personal communication devices. Drivers are permitted to use hands-free cell phones while driving in accordance with state law. Report unsafe conditions immediately to your supervisor. Employees may not talk or text on their hand-held devices while driving or walking. AmeriCU will maintain safety and health practices consistent with the needs of our industry. If an employee is ever in doubt about how to safely perform a job, it is that employee\u2019s responsibility to ask their supervisor for assistance. All injuries that occur on the job must be reported immediately to Human Resources. Compliance with these safety rules is considered a condition of employment. Non\u2011compliance will be treated like any other violation of established Credit Union rules and will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Therefore, it is a requirement that each supervisor make the safety of employees an integral part of her/his regular management functions. It is the responsibility of each employee to accept and follow established safety regulations and procedures. Various documents on workplace safety and wellness are available on the Credit Union intranet. Safety questions, concerns or suggestions should be forwarded to your supervisor and/or the Safety Team. EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS Our text/email alert system is an effective tool for communicating directly with employees in various situations. It is used to warn employees of the risk of danger during an emergency and to advise them when it starts, keep them informed as it develops and provide an all-clear when it\u2019s over. Additionally, it is used to advise employees of FC location closures due to power failure or adverse weather. Employees are expected to ensure that their contact numbers maintained in the ADP Workforce Now Portal are up to date. FIRE SAFETY AND EMERGENCY EVACUATION Your safety and the safety of our members and visitors are of utmost importance. It is important for you to know the location of exits, fire extinguishers and emergency evacuation routes. All building alarms are to be taken seriously. If there is a fire or other emergency requiring evacuation from the building, please: Immediately evacuate yourself and all visitors from the building. Meet at designated locations. Supervisors should perform employee headcounts and report any missing persons immediately to officials in charge. Call emergency officials \u2013 fire, police, ambulance. For steps specific to your location, please refer to the Fire Procedures located on the home page of the intranet. AIRBORNE INFECTIOUS DISEASE POLICY In compliance with the New York Health and Essential Rights Act (NY HERO Act), the Credit Union\u2019s HERO Act policy protects employees against exposure and disease during an airborne infectious disease outbreak. The Credit Union\u2019s HERO Act policy becomes effective when an airborne infectious disease is designated by the New York State Commissioner of Health as a highly contagious communicable disease that presents a serious risk of harm to the public health. When designated, the Credit Union will provide a copy of the adopted airborne infectious disease exposure prevention plan and post the same in a visible and prominent location within each worksite. Employees may view the HERO Act policy as Appendix B. ROBBERY In the event of a robbery, the safety of our employees and members is of primary importance. Please refer to ACU-11-004 Security and Operations Manual for detailed instructions and guidance. This document can be found in PolicyStat. If you have any questions regarding robbery procedures please speak with your manager or supervisor. EMPLOYEE ON-THE-JOB ACCIDENT/INJURIES If you are involved in an accident or injury, you are required to notify your supervisor immediately. First aid supplies are located in each department/financial center. If necessary, medical attention will be immediately summoned for your care. Under no circumstances should one employee transport another employee needing urgent care to a medical facility, no matter how close the facility; 911 should be called. Injured employees are discouraged from transporting themselves to medical care. Supervisors must immediately report all such incidents to the Human Resources Department and immediately complete the _Employee Accident/Injury Report_ form located in Knowledge Base on the intranet or under the Resources tab in the Workforce Now Portal and submit it to the Human Resources Department. NON-EMPLOYEE ACCIDENT/INJURIES Accidents or injuries, no matter how small, involving non-employee members or visitors should immediately be reported to your supervisor. If necessary, emergency medical care should be provided. Under no circumstances will an employee transport a non-employee member or visitor needing medical care to a medical facility, no matter how close the facility; 911 should be called. Injured non-employee members or visitors should be discouraged from transporting themselves to medical care. Supervisors should immediately document the incident and email the incident report to insurance@americu.com for risk management consideration and claim administration.

Refer to ACU-08-005 Social Media Policy. E-Mail and Internet Use Employees should have no expectation of privacy when using AmeriCU\u2019s e-mail and Internet services. The Credit Union reserves the right to review and monitor an employee\u2019s email and internet use at any time without further notice to the employee. Employees must limit their personal use of AmeriCU\u2019s e-mail and the Internet services. These services should be used for Credit Union business or pre-approved for volunteerism in the community. All e-mails generated at the Credit Union are stored and can be used by the Credit Union for any reason the Credit Union deems appropriate. Employees should be aware e-mail is not considered private or secure. E-mail communication should be thought out carefully and written in a professional manner. Confidential member information must not be sent via e-mail outside the Credit Union without an explicit business reason (and in that instance, it must be sent confidentially). Chain letter and junk e-mails should not be forwarded to co-workers or any other individual. Instead, they should be sent to the Information Security Manager, then deleted from your inbox. Internet and/or e-mail use for illicit, harassing, pornographic or immoral activities is strictly prohibited. Improper Use of Telecommunications: All employees are expected to know and follow this policy. Nothing in this policy, however, is intended to prevent employees from engaging in concerted activity protected by law. If you have any questions regarding this policy, please ask your supervisor or Human Resources before acting. Unauthorized or improper use of the AmeriCU network service or telecommunication practices will not be tolerated. Misuse of Credit Union assets is punishable by discipline, up to and including termination of employment and/or criminal prosecution. Electronic Monitoring All of the Credit Union\u2019s electronic systems, including computers and telephones, and all communications and information transmitted by, received from, or stored in electronic systems are the property of the Credit Union, and should not be considered private or confidential. Employees have no right to privacy as to any information or file transmitted or stored through the Credit Union\u2019s electronic systems. Employees are hereby advised that any and all telephone conversations or transmissions, electronic mail or transmissions, or internet access or usage by an employee by any electronic device or system, including but not limited to the use of a computer, telephone, wire, radio or electromagnetic, photoelectronic or photo-optical systems may be subject to monitoring at any and all times and by any lawful means. As a result, all employee communications and use of the Internet that occurs on the Credit Union\u2019s technological resources are not considered private. Therefore, employees should treat all activities as such. The Credit Union reserves the right to monitor employee use of its technological resources at any time. By using the Credit Union\u2019s electronic systems, you consent to the Credit Union\u2019s right to intercept, access, monitor, use, and disclose, at any time and for any purpose, all content accessed, created, transmitted, received or stored on or via its electronic systems. SECURITY Alarms: Due to job responsibilities, certain employees are entrusted with building keys and security codes to arm and disarm the alarm system in the building(s). Employees may never reveal the security codes to anyone. Each building has a system to indicate whether the building is safe or not to enter. If it is not safe for you to enter, you will have to wait to enter the building until an employee with arm/disarm capabilities arrives, disarms the building, and posts the \u201call clear\u201d signal. Your manager or immediate supervisor at your assigned location will review location specific procedures with you. Building Access Card: All employees will be assigned a building access card with their picture and the AmeriCU logo printed on the car which will allow them to enter their assigned financial center as well as other secured areas in the building specific to their position. A four-digit pin code will also be required to gain access at the external employee entrance door(s). Pin codes are assigned by the Risk Management Division. Employees are required to use their own badge to access non-public areas of the building and are prohibited from allowing unauthorized personnel into secured areas. Piggybacking is not allowed; employees must swipe at every card reader even if the door is being held open. Employees are prohibited from allowing any other employee or individual to utilize their access card. If a card is lost, employees should immediately report it to their supervisor and the Risk Management Division so that the card can be deactivated and a new one issued. If a card is found after it has been deactivated, it should be returned to the Risk Management Division. PARKING Employees must park only in designated employee parking areas. Parking spaces closest to the main entrances are for member use only. Each office will designate employee parking areas. For safety and security reasons, please keep your vehicles locked. AmeriCU is not responsible for any theft or damage to your vehicle. Failure to park in designated employee parking areas may result in discipline, up to and including termination. CARE OF EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES Employees have the responsibility to safeguard the Credit Union\u2019s property. We expect that equipment will be used with care. If you are not sure how to operate a piece of equipment, check with your supervisor. If a piece of equipment is not functioning properly, bring it to the attention of your supervisor, so it may be properly repaired. Try to avoid wasting supplies; even small items can add up to a large expense. Your supervisor will explain the procedure for ordering supplies and requesting equipment maintenance. Employees are prohibited from taking the Credit Union\u2019s supplies for personal use. OTHER PROPERTY OF AMERICU It should be noted that all offices, desks, files, and so forth are the property of AmeriCU. They are issued to employees for use only in completing their job responsibilities for the Credit Union in the course their employment. Employees should not assume these areas are private to themselves. The Credit Union reserves the right to search any employee\u2019s office, desk, files, or any other area on the Credit Union\u2019s premises at any time for any reason. HOUSEKEEPING Our working environment reflects the quality of work we do, and the service provided to our members. Good housekeeping in your work area is important as it helps ensure a safe and pleasant place to work. Visitors and members who come into the Credit Union readily relate the appearance of buildings and facilities with the way we conduct our business. It is expected that positions with direct member contact may have a different standard than other positions within the Credit Union. Your manager/supervisor will provide guidelines for your department. However, it is strongly suggested that employees use break rooms to eat or drink while you are at the Credit Union. Break rooms are to be kept very clean. All dishes and cups should be washed, dried, and stored in cabinets nightly. All food should be stored and disposed of properly. Items left unattended for an extended period of time will be discarded. You are expected to help within your department or financial center to keep the break area clean. TOBACCO FREE WORKPLACE To provide a smoke-free workplace, smoking and the use of any tobacco products (including chewing tobacco), electronic smoking devices and e-cigarettes are not permitted inside any AmeriCU facility, exterior space or vehicle belonging to the Credit Union. Each location has designated outdoor areas in which smoking is permitted. Employees are also prohibited from smoking marijuana (cannabis) on Credit Union property or while performing work for the Credit Union. CREDIT UNION-OWNED VEHICLE POLICY The safety and well-being of our employees is of critical importance to the Credit Union. AmeriCU\u2019s Credit Union-Owned Vehicle Policy provides guidance on the proper use of Credit Union vehicles and ensures the safety of those individuals who drive them. Employees authorized to operate Credit Union-owned vehicles will be expected to abide by the provisions documented in ACU-07-006 AmeriCU Credit Union-Owned Vehicles policy that is posted in PolicyStat. EMPLOYMENT RECORDS, PAYROLL AND TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT EMPLOYMENT RECORDS Your personnel file is maintained by the Human Resources Department. It contains documents related to your compensation history, benefits, employment status and performance. For a variety of reasons, it is important for you to notify Human Resources of any personal changes you may have. Information that must be kept current includes such things as home address, phone number(s), emergency contact(s), marital status, legal name, direct deposit information, beneficiary designations, dependent information, etc. Please note, changing information in your AmeriCU member account(s) does not change it on record in the Human Resources Department; such changes must be reported separately. Any changes to your state-issued licenses or to your criminal record must be reported immediately to the Human Resources Department. For example, conviction of a felony offense, or any other events adversely affecting your license(s) and/or bondability, must be reported immediately to the Human Resources Department. Anything you would like to be placed in your employment record must be submitted to Human Resources for approval. Such items may include education course certificates, professional certifications, newspaper articles, and other recognition. Current employees may review the contents of their personnel file by calling the Human Resources Department for an appointment. During the review appointment, which will be done in the presence of Human Resources, the file may not be copied, altered or removed. PAY All employees are paid on a biweekly basis on Thursdays. Payroll is processed by the Human Resources Department. Paycheck processing is done by an outside company; therefore, employees cannot receive their pay early or have an advancement of pay. RECORDING YOUR TIME WORKED Hourly employees are required to log into the ADP Workforce Now Portal to record their time worked. You must log in each time you: Begin work Go out and come in for/from meal period Go out and come in for/from an appointment Leave for the day You should not work any hours that are not authorized by your manager. Do not start work early, finish work late, work during a meal break, or perform any other extra or overtime work unless you are authorized to do so and that time is recorded on your time record. Employees are prohibited from performing any \u201coff-the-clock\u201d work. You are required to send all time off requests for approval via Workforce Now to your supervisor or designee. Once your request is approved by your supervisor, it will automatically be entered into your timesheet. If you forget to record your time, you must notify your supervisor immediately. It is important that your time stamps reflect your actual hours worked. Overtime must be authorized in advance by your supervisor. Failure to consistently punch in and out for lunches and other time away from work will result in corrective action. Exempt employees are required to record their use of paid time off and/or any unpaid time off in Workforce Now. Failure to record your time consistently and accurately through Workforce Now may be grounds for disciplinary action up to and including immediate termination. Under no circumstances may any employee alter or falsify time records or record time for another employee as this will be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. DEDUCTIONS FROM WAGES The Credit Union withholds taxes, social security (FICA) and other deductions required by law from employees\u2019 wages. All employees of AmeriCU are required to provide proper information via withholding certificates for deduction of federal and state income tax. It is the employee\u2019s responsibility to provide accurate and updated information. Other lawful payroll deductions allowed by the Credit Union may be made from your paycheck provided a signed authorization is received from you. These include deductions such as 401k contribution and loan payments, United Way contributions, Employee Fund, group insurances and supplemental insurances. AmeriCU does not condone improper deductions from employees\u2019 wages and endeavors to ensure that unauthorized wage deductions, payroll errors and the like do not occur. Employees should review their paychecks for errors and report any mistakes to Human Resources immediately. Deductions from Exempt Employees\u2019 Pay In accordance with applicable state and federal law, exempt employees are paid on a salaried basis. Accordingly, they receive a predetermined amount each pay period that is not reduced because of variations in the quality or quantity of their work. However, the Company may make deductions from an exempt employee\u2019s pay under the following, limited circumstances: Absences from work for one or more full days for personal reasons other than sickness or disability; Absences of one or more full days due to sickness or disability if the deduction is made in accordance with the Company\u2019s plan, policy, or practice of providing compensation for salary lost due to illness; To offset jury and witness fees or military pay; Unpaid suspensions of one or more full days for violations of workplace conduct rules; Penalties for infractions of safety rules of major significance; Weeks in which unpaid FMLA leave is taken; or During the initial or last week of employment if the employee does not work the entire workweek. It is the Credit Union's policy to comply with the salary basis requirements of the FLSA and New York's Labor Law. To ensure that you are paid properly for all time worked and that no improper deductions are made, you should review your pay stub to make sure it is correct. If an employee believes that an improper deduction has been made from their salary, the employee should immediately report this information to Human Resources. Reports of improper deductions will be investigated promptly. If it is determined that an improper deduction has occurred, the employee will be reimbursed promptly for any improper deduction made. The Credit Union is committed to full compliance with this policy. The Credit Union will not tolerate any form of retaliation against any individuals who report alleged violations of this policy, or who cooperate in the investigation of such reported violations. Anyone that engages in retaliation in violation of this policy will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination of employment. WAGE GARNISHMENTS AmeriCU complies with all valid claims against the wages of an employee. If a wage garnishment, child support order, or some other legally valid claim is received by AmeriCU against your wages, you will be notified of the details. The Credit Union is required to comply with the provisions of the garnishment notice or order as soon as practicable after it is received. Wage garnishments from an employee\u2019s pay will not be delayed in order for the employee to reconcile the situation. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT All employment relationships with AmeriCU are on an at-will basis. We expect employees who resign from AmeriCU to conduct themselves in a professional manner and to provide notice of voluntary resignation in accordance with this policy to allow the organization to plan for its staffing needs. All employees are expected to provide two (2) weeks\u2019 advance notice of voluntary resignation or retirement and to work through the notice period unless their supervisor sets an earlier end date. Paid time off may not be used during the notice period, unless such time is being used for a legally protected absence. An employee who provides the applicable amount of advance notice and works through the notice period will be paid out their available PTO per policy upon termination. An employee who fails to provide the applicable amount of advance notice and/or who fails to work through the applicable notice period will not be eligible for a payout and forfeit all accrued, unused PTO. Additionally, employees who are involuntarily terminated forfeit all accrued, unused PTO upon termination. Separating employees are responsible for returning all Credit Union property such as all confidential Credit Union information in any form, building access card, credit cards, keys, cell phone, smart phones, laptop, etc. to their supervisor. Supervisors are responsible for collecting returned property from separating employees. The Credit Union may take all action deemed appropriate to recover and/or protect its property. Separating employees will be responsible for paying back tuition reimbursement per the Educational Reimbursement Program. Final pay will be issued in accordance with all applicable laws and generally received in the next normally processed payroll cycle. LEAVES OF ABSENCE FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) requires employers with 50 or more employees to provide eligible employees with unpaid leave. There are two types of leave available: the basic 12-week leave entitlement (Basic FMLA Leave) and the 26-week military caregiver leave entitlement (Military Caregiver Leave). AmeriCU has established this FMLA policy to summarize its employees\u2019 rights to leave under the FMLA. Employees who desire to take FMLA leave should contact Human Resources to obtain the necessary paperwork. The definitions, limitations, eligibility and notice requirements, and substitution rights of the FMLA and its regulations are all incorporated herein by reference. Eligibility Any employee is eligible for leave if he/she has worked for the Credit Union for at least twelve (12) months and has worked at least 1,250 hours over the previous twelve\u2011month period (hour\u2019s paid, but not worked, and unpaid leave will not be counted in determining the 1,250 hours of service). Only employees who work at a location that has 50 AmeriCU employees within a 75-mile radius, are eligible for leave under this Policy. Basic FMLA Leave Eligible employees may take an unpaid leave of up to twelve (12) weeks during any twelve-month period for any of the following reasons: The birth of the employee\u2019s son or daughter and to care for the child during the first twelve (12) months following birth; The placement of a son or daughter with the employee for adoption or foster care and to care for the child during the first twelve (12) months following placement; To care for an immediate family member (spouse, son, daughter, or parent) of the employee if that individual has a serious health condition; A serious health condition of the employee that renders the employee unable to perform their job functions; Due to a \u201cqualifying exigency\u201d arising out of the fact that the spouse, son, daughter or parent of the employee is on covered active duty, or has been notified of an impending call to covered active duty in the Armed Forces. The terms \u201cqualifying exigency\u201d and \u201ccovered active duty\u201d are defined in accordance with the FMLA. If you have any questions about what constitutes \u201ccovered active duty\u201d or a \u201cqualifying exigency\u201d please contact Human Resources. The relevant twelve-month period used to determine eligibility for Basic FMLA Leave will be calculated on a rolling basis, measured backwards from the date the employee uses any such leave. Employees are limited to a maximum of twelve (12) weeks of leave in a twelve-month rolling period for any one, or combination of, the reasons listed above as \u201cBasic FMLA Leave.\u201d Military Caregiver Leave Eligible employees may take an unpaid leave of up to 26 weeks during a single twelve-month period in order to care for a spouse, son, daughter, parent or next of kin (nearest blood relative) who is a covered service-member. This type of leave is referred in this policy as \u201cmilitary caregiver leave\u201d. A \u201ccovered service-member,\u201d as it applies to this form of leave, is: (1) a current member of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard or Reserves, who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status, or is otherwise on the temporary disability retired list, for a serious injury or illness; or (2) a covered veteran who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation or therapy for a serious injury or illness. The terms \u201ccovered veteran\u201d and \u201cserious injury or illness\u201d are defined in accordance with the FMLA. If you have any questions about what constitutes a \u201ccovered veteran\u201d or a \u201cserious injury or illness,\u201d please contact Human Resources. The \u201csingle twelve-month period\u201d for purposes of military caregiver leave is defined as the twelve-month period measured forward from the date an employee\u2019s first FMLA leave to care for the covered service-member begins. During this 12-month period, an eligible employee\u2019s FMLA leave entitlement is limited to a combined total of 26 workweeks of leave for any FMLA\u2011qualifying reason. For example, an eligible employee may, during the single twelve-month period, take 16 weeks of military caregiver leave and ten (10) weeks of FMLA leave to care for a newborn child. This 26-week maximum leave entitlement does not mean that an employee who takes three (3) weeks of military caregiver leave is entitled to 23 weeks of leave for the employee\u2019s own serious health condition or any other qualifying reason for Basic FMLA Leave. Instead, the twelve (12) week maximum stated above continues to apply to all other kinds of Basic FMLA Leave. Substitution of Accrued Paid Leave FMLA leave is generally unpaid. AmeriCU will require an employee to use their paid time off in place of unpaid leave. Any remaining FMLA leave after accrued paid time is exhausted will be unpaid. Any paid leave will run concurrently with and be counted as part of the statutory twelve (or 26) weeks of unpaid FMLA leave. The substitution of paid leave time for unpaid FMLA leave does not extend the twelve-week (or 26-week) leave period. Employees who are on a leave of absence that is covered by payments such as disability benefits, Paid Family Leave, or Workers\u2019 Compensation benefits will not be required to substitute accrued paid leave while receiving these benefit payments. Any leave of absence taken pursuant to an applicable disability law, Paid Family Leave or Workers\u2019 Compensation law will be run concurrently with FMLA leave where the leave qualifies under both laws. How Leave is Taken Leave because of a serious health condition involving an employee or an employee\u2019s spouse, child, or parent may be granted on an intermittent basis (in separate blocks of time due to a single health condition) or on a reduced- schedule leave (reducing the number of hours worked per workweek or workday) when necessary because of the nature of the medical condition and the scheduling of medical treatments. Intermittent or reduced-schedule leave also may be available in appropriate circumstances for qualifying exigency leave and/or military caregiver leave. If the requested leave is for the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care, use of intermittent leave may be approved at the Credit Union\u2019s discretion. Intermittent or reduced leave schedules are subject to the Credit Union\u2019s approval unless medically necessary. In some circumstances, the Credit Union may temporarily transfer an employee to an alternate position with equivalent pay and benefits which better accommodates intermittent absences. _Note_ : When FMLA is running concurrently with New York Paid Family Leave, employees are permitted to take leave intermittently (in full day increments) to bond with a new child following the birth, adoption or placement in foster care. An employee on short-term disability or workers\u2019 compensation will be automatically placed on FMLA leave if they are eligible for FMLA leave and their medical condition constitutes a serious health condition for FMLA purposes. In the case of leave related to the serious health condition of the employee or the family member, the employee must make a reasonable effort to schedule planned medical treatments so as not to disrupt unduly the operations of the Credit Union. Notification An employee who seeks to take FMLA leave must provide the Credit Union with sufficient information to understand that the employee needs leave for FMLA- qualifying reasons, including information on the medical condition or other qualifying reason for the absence, and the anticipated duration of the absence, or the circumstances supporting the need for qualifying exigency leave or military caregiver leave. The employee must also inform the Credit Union if the requested leave is for a reason which FMLA leave was previously taken or certified. Employees must provide the Credit Union with at least thirty (30) days advance notice in situations where the need for leave is foreseeable. In cases where the need for leave is not foreseeable (as with a sudden illness or accident), employees should contact the Credit Union and request leave as soon as reasonably possible. Failure to provide such notice may be grounds for delaying the start of the FMLA leave or denying the request for leave. Required forms are available in Human Resources. It is the employee\u2019s responsibility to comply with any customary call-in procedures for reporting an absence, unless unusual circumstances prevent the employee from so doing. Certification Employees who wish to take FMLA leave to care for their own or a family member\u2019s serious health condition must provide the Credit Union with medical certification documenting the need for such leave. Employees who wish to take leave for a qualifying exigency or to take military caregiver leave must provide the Credit Union with certification of, as appropriate, the family member\u2019s call to duty and/or injury and need for care. The employee must provide the requested certification to the Credit Union within fifteen (15) calendar days after the Credit Union\u2019s request, unless to do so is not practicable despite the employee\u2019s diligent, good faith efforts. Failure to provide requested medical certification in a timely manner may result in denial of leave until it is provided. The employee certification must be complete and sufficient. In the event that the certification is deficient, the Credit Union will advise the employee in writing what additional information is necessary to make the certification complete and sufficient and give the employee seven (7) calendar days to cure any such deficiency. If the deficiencies are not cured in the resubmitted certification, the Credit Union may deny the taking of FMLA leave. If the Credit Union has reason to doubt the validity of a medical certification, it may require the employee to obtain the opinion of a second health care provider designated or approved by the Credit Union. The Credit Union may require the employee to obtain subsequent recertification and/or an annual certification on a reasonable basis as permitted by law. Health Benefits and FMLA Group health benefits will be provided during the leave on the same basis as before the leave. Specifically, the Credit Union will continue to pay the Credit Union\u2019s portion of the employee\u2019s group medical premium for a period not to exceed twelve weeks. Employees who are responsible for a portion of the insurance premiums must continue to make those payments. If paid leave is substituted for unpaid FMLA leave, the Credit Union will deduct the employee\u2019s portion of the group medical premium as a regular payroll deduction; otherwise, the employee will be responsible for ensuring that the payment is made. The employee\u2019s coverage and the coverage of all enrolled dependents will be terminated if the payment of the employee\u2019s portion of the premium is more than thirty (30) days late. If the payment is more than fifteen (15) days late, the Credit Union will send the employee a letter to this effect. If the Credit Union does not receive the payment for outstanding benefit premiums within fifteen (15) days after the date of that letter, the employee\u2019s coverage will terminate for non-payment of their required contributions. In some instances, the Credit Union may recover premiums it paid to maintain insurance coverage if an employee does not return to work following FMLA leave. Other Benefits Other benefits such as paid time off and pre-tax contributions will not continue during FMLA leave. However, while an employee is using their paid time off, he/she will continue to accrue paid time off. For other benefits, such as life insurance, AmeriCU and the employee may make arrangements to continue benefits during periods of unpaid FMLA leave. Certain requirements in benefit contracts may apply. Reinstatement Employees who return from FMLA leave will be restored to their original or equivalent position with equivalent pay, benefits and other employment terms. An exception to this policy of restoration may be made with respect to \u201ckey\u201d employees ( _i.e._ , salaried employees in the top ten (10) percent of the Credit Union\u2019s payroll). The use of FMLA leave will not result in the loss of any employment benefit that accrued prior to the start of the leave. If an employee fails to return at the end of approved FMLA leave, and if he/she has not obtained prior approval by the Credit Union to continue the leave of absence, the employee will be deemed to have resigned. An employee returning from FMLA leave due to their own serious health condition will be required to furnish medical certification from a healthcare provider that they is fit to return to work. This fitness for duty certification must specifically address the employee\u2019s ability to perform the essential functions of their job. Failure to provide such medical certification may result in delay or denial of reinstatement. Fraud An employee who fraudulently obtains FMLA leave is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. FMLA Posting In accordance with federal law, the Credit Union posts a notice summarizing the provisions of the FMLA, including enforcement of the law. A copy of the notice posting is also attached to this Handbook at Appendix C. PAID FAMILY LEAVE AmeriCU provides its employees with paid leave benefits in accordance with the New York State Paid Family Leave Benefits Law (\u201cPFL\u201d). PFL is designed to enable eligible employees to take time off from work to care for family members under circumstances as outlined below. Employees taking PFL will receive partial wage replacement through an insurance policy that is funded by weekly, post-tax employee payroll deductions (established annually in accordance with state law). Payroll deductions will begin on the employee\u2019s first day of employment. Participation in the PFL program is mandatory for all employees, except for those individuals eligible for a waiver (explained below). Employee Eligibility A full-time employee (regularly scheduled to work at least 20 hours per week) is eligible to take PFL after he/she has been employed by AmeriCU for 26 consecutive weeks. A part-time employee (regularly scheduled to work less than 20 hours per week) is eligible to take PFL after working for AmeriCU for 175 days. _Note:_ Time spent on paid time off, will count towards an employee\u2019s eligibility determination, provided deductions were taken during that period of paid time off. However, time that an employee spends on New York State Disability Leave or unpaid leave will _not_ be counted towards an employee\u2019s eligibility determination. Qualifying Reasons for Leave Under PFL Eligible employees may apply to take PFL for the following qualifying reasons: Caring: To provide care for their child (regardless of age), parent (including parent-in-law), grandparent, grandchild, sibling, spouse and/or domestic partner with a \u201cserious health condition\u201d. \u201cProviding care\u201d includes: necessary physical care, emotional support, visitation, assistance in treatment, transportation, arranging for a change in care, assistance with essential daily living matters, and personal attendant services. Note: During the leave, the employee must be in close physical proximity to the identified family member who is receiving care. \u201cSerious Health Condition\u201d means: an illness, injury, impairment or physical or mental condition that involves either in-patient care or continuing treatment (or supervision) by a health care provider. Questions regarding the definition of \u201cserious health condition\u201d should be directed to the AVP, Talent Solutions. Note: Absent complications, the common cold, the flu, an earache, an upset stomach, a minor ulcer, a headache (other than a migraine), a routine dental procedure / orthodontia problem, a periodontal disease, etc. does not typically constitute a serious health condition. Bonding: To bond with their child following the child\u2019s birth, adoption or placement in foster care. In the case of adoption or placement, PFL may be taken prior to the adoption or placement if the employee\u2019s absence is necessary for the placement or adoption to proceed. PFL taken for these circumstances must be used within one year of the first day of leave, or within one year of the adoption / placement, whichever is earlier. In the case of the birth of a newborn child, PFL taken to bond with the child must be used within the first year following the child\u2019s birth. Preparing: To prepare for, or attend to, a qualifying exigency arising out of their family member\u2019s military service. \u201cFamily member\u201d, as applied to this particular provision, shall include the employee\u2019s spouse, domestic partner, child or parent who is currently on active duty or has been notified of an impending call to active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States. \u201cQualifying exigency\u201d shall have the same meaning and interpretation under PFL as the term is currently used under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d). Questions regarding the definition or application of \u201cqualifying exigency\u201d should be directed to the AVP, Talent Solutions. _PFL is not available for the employee\u2019s own disability or serious health condition._ Disability, FMLA or a non-FMLA medical leave may be available in those circumstances. Please see AmeriCU\u2019s Short-Term Disability, FMLA and other non-FMLA medical leave policies for additional information . _Note_ : _PFL_ _will run concurrently with leave under the FMLA where the reason for leave qualifies under both PFL and __FMLA_. In these cases, employees will be required to comply with all applicable employee requirements ( _e.g._ , application, certification, notice, etc.) under both policies. Accordingly, employees should also review and refer to AmeriCU\u2019s FMLA Policy set forth in the Employee Handbook. If an employee\u2019s need for leave qualifies under both PFL and FMLA, but the employee declines to apply for PFL benefits (despite being notified that the reason for leave is a PFL-qualifying reason), any leave taken by the employee for such reason will nevertheless be counted against the employee\u2019s PFL allotment. Waivers Employees have the opportunity to waive PFL benefits under the following limited circumstances: The employee\u2019s regular work schedule is 20 or more hours per week, but the employee will not work for AmeriCU for 26 consecutive weeks. The employee\u2019s regular work schedule is less than 20 hours per week and the employee will not work for AmeriCU for 175 days during a consecutive 52-week period. If an employee elects to waive PFL coverage, AmeriCU will not take PFL payroll deductions from that employee. However, if an employee elects to waive PFL coverage and their regular schedule changes such that he/she works for either 26 consecutive weeks or 175 days in a consecutive 52-week period, the employee\u2019s waiver will be automatically revoked under the law. When such a waiver is revoked, AmeriCU will notify the employee regarding their contribution obligations. Thereafter, AmeriCU may begin taking PFL payroll deductions from the employee, including any retroactive amounts from the employee\u2019s date of hire or the amount necessary to prevent AmeriCU from having to pay the applicable PFL insurance premium. Amount of PFL Leave Available Eligible employees are entitled to up to 12 weeks of leave during a 52-week period. The 52\u2011week period is calculated by measuring backwards from each day for which PFL is taken. PFL may be taken in daily or weekly increments. In the event that an employee also collects New York State Disability Leave Benefits (\u201cDBL\u201d) for their own disability, the maximum amount of time that can be taken for both DBL and PFL can total no more than 26 weeks during a 52-week time period. AmeriCU may not permit more than one employee to use PFL to care for the same family member at the same time. Example: If both spouses work for AmeriCU, AmeriCU may deny PFL to one spouse _if_ both employees have requested to take PFL during the same period of time to bond with the same child. However, both spouses could take PFL at different times to bond with the same child. PFL Benefit Levels Employees do not continue to receive their full pay from AmeriCU during PFL. Rather, they will receive a partial wage replacement benefit payment which will be paid directly from AmeriCU\u2019s insurance carrier. Employees will receive 67% of their average weekly wage, up to a cap of 67% of the current Statewide Average Weekly Wage. NYS sets the Statewide Average Weekly Wage each year. If PFL leave spans across calendar years, the employee\u2019s benefit amount / rate is set at the time the PFL leave begins and does not increase during the leave period. Intermittent Leave PFL may be taken on either a weekly or intermittent basis ( _i.e._ , separate blocks of time). Intermittent PFL must be used in full-day increments. If an employee takes intermittent FMLA in partial day increments for a reason that also qualifies for PFL, and the employee is paid and works at least part of a day, AmeriCU will track the hours taken against the employee\u2019s FMLA allotment. When the partial day increments taken total the number of hours in the employee\u2019s regular workday, AmeriCU will deduct one day of PFL from the employee\u2019s available PFL allotment. Employee Notice Requirements Employees must provide AmeriCU with notice regarding the need for PFL before the start of the leave; notice should be given to the AVP, Talent Solutions. Employees are required to provide sufficient information and notice to inform AmeriCU of the qualifying event, the anticipated timing, and the duration of leave. If the need for PFL is foreseeable ( _i.e._ , planned medical treatments / appointments, to bond with a child, a qualifying military exigency, etc.), the employee must provide AmeriCU with at least 30 days\u2019 advance notice, or as soon as the need for leave becomes known. If the need for PFL is not foreseeable because of a medical emergency, change in circumstances or lack of advance knowledge, the employee must notify AmeriCU as soon as practicable under the circumstances. It should be practicable for the employee to follow AmeriCU\u2019s usual and customary call-in procedure, which requires employees to notify their immediate supervisor as soon as possible, but no later than one (1) hour prior to their scheduled starting time. If an employee fails to provide 30 days\u2019 advance notice of foreseeable PFL and provides no reasonable excuse for the delay, the insurance carrier may partially deny the claim for a period of up to 30 days from the date the notice is given. If leave is taken on an intermittent basis, the employee must provide notice as soon as is practicable before each day taken as intermittent leave. When the need for PFL is foreseeable, including intermittent leave, employees are encouraged to consult with their supervisor and the AVP, Talent Solutions regarding leave scheduling so as to minimize operational disruptions to AmeriCU. Applying for PFL Benefits Employees needing PFL must notify the AVP, Talent Solutions. In order to receive income replacement benefits while on PFL, an employee must submit a claim form to AmeriCU\u2019s PFL insurance carrier using the applicable _Request for Paid Family Leave_ forms. The claim form(s) will provide details regarding the documentation that will be required to support the request for PFL benefits. These forms may be obtained from the AVP, Talent Solutions. The AVP, Talent Solutions will assist employees in filing PFL claims with the insurance carrier, but it is critical that employees provide the AVP, Talent Solutions with required documentation timely in order to facilitate the filing of the claim. While employees have 30 days from the date PFL is taken to file the claim, employees should consider filing the claim as quickly as possible to ensure prompt payment of PFL benefits if the claim is ultimately approved. _An employee will not receive benefit payments until the claim is fully submitted to the carrier and approved_. The insurance carrier has 18 days, from the date of submission, to approve or deny the claim. An employee who is absent from work and whose PFL claim is later denied by the insurance carrier, may be authorized for leave, if eligible, under AmeriCU\u2019s other leave of absence policies. If the employee is not eligible under any other leave of absence policy, the employee\u2019s absence may be treated as unexcused and subject to AmeriCU\u2019s attendance policy. In addition, the employee will be required to apply any paid time off. _Reminders_ : If the employee\u2019s need for leave is for an FMLA-qualifying event and the individual is an eligible employee under the FMLA, the employee must also apply for FMLA pursuant to AmeriCU\u2019s FMLA Policy. If an employee\u2019s need for leave qualifies under both PFL and FMLA, but the employee declines to apply for PFL benefits (despite being notified that the reason for leave is a PFL-qualifying reason), any leave taken by the employee for such reason will nevertheless be counted against the employee\u2019s PFL allotment. Substitution of Paid Time Off If an employee takes PFL, but would prefer to receive their full pay, the employee may elect to substitute a full day of accrued paid time off. In this instance, the employee is still required to file a claim with AmeriCU\u2019s insurance carrier, though the employee will not receive the PFL wage replacement benefit. Any paid time off substituted by the employee will be counted against their PFL allotment. Maintenance of Health Benefits While an employee is out of work on an approved PFL, AmeriCU will maintain the employee\u2019s health benefits as if the employee continued to be actively employed. Specifically, AmeriCU will continue to pay its portion of the group health insurance premium (where applicable) while the employee is on PFL. The employee will be responsible for continuing to contribute their portion of the health insurance premium(s) and is expected to make arrangements with the AVP, Talent Solutions to ensure timely payment. If payment is more than 30 days late, the employee\u2019s health insurance coverage may be dropped for the duration of PFL. AmeriCU will provide 15 days\u2019 notice prior to terminating coverage. Restoration of Employment An employee who returns to work at the conclusion of an approved period of PFL will be restored to the same position or to a comparable position (with comparable pay, benefits and other terms and conditions of employment). If the employee has exhausted all weeks of available PFL and is still unable to return to work, the employee is no longer provided with any job restoration rights under PFL, unless other job protections apply ( _e.g._ , FMLA). Appeal Rights If an employee\u2019s request for PFL has been denied by the insurance carrier, the employee has the right to appeal the determination through an arbitration proceeding. Information regarding the appeal process is available from the insurance carrier. Protection from Discrimination and Retaliation AmeriCU will not discriminate and/or retaliate against any employee for inquiring about, applying for, or using PFL benefits. Employees who believe they have experienced discrimination and/or retaliation should immediately notify their supervisor, the AVP, Talent Solutions or any other member of management. Fraud An employee who fraudulently obtains PFL, or who uses PFL in an improper manner, is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Questions An employee who has questions concerning PFL is encouraged to contact the AVP, Talent Solutions for more information, clarification and/or appropriate guidance. UNPAID MEDICAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE (NON-FMLA) Employees who are ineligible for FMLA leave or who have exhausted their FMLA leave entitlement, and who have used all of their accrued, unused paid time off, may apply for an unpaid medical leave of absence. AmeriCU will evaluate each request on an individualized basis, taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each particular situation. While an employee is on an Unpaid Medical Leave of Absence, Credit Union will maintain whatever benefits the employee was enrolled in prior to the leave for up to six (6) months, provided the employee makes arrangements and continues to pay their portion of the premiums for such insurance. Except in cases of emergency, requests for medical leave must be made in writing, at least two (2) weeks prior to the beginning of the requested leave period. The request must be accompanied by a written report from the employee\u2019s health care provider detailing why such leave is medically necessary. In the event AmeriCU has reason to believe an employee who requests a medical leave of absence or who is on an unpaid medical leave is able to work, AmeriCU reserves the right to require the employee to submit to further examination by a doctor, selected by AmeriCU, at AmeriCU\u2019s expense. An employee returning to work will be assigned to their same position unless holding the position open would impose an undue hardship. If AmeriCU cannot hold the employee\u2019s position open during the entire leave period without incurring undue hardship, AmeriCU will consider whether it has a vacant, equivalent position for which the employee is qualified and to which the employee can be returned to at the conclusion of their leave. Medical documentation will be required for any employee returning to work from a medical leave of absence. Employees who are able to work, but fail to return on the agreed expiration date of a leave of absence, or who have not requested or do not have an approved extension for additional leave, will assume the employee has resigned and their employment will be terminated. Nothing in this policy is intended to conflict with any state or federal law or regulation. If such a conflict exists, the applicable law or regulation prevails. AmeriCU will consider the facts and circumstances of each particular case when determining whether a medical leave is necessary and/or appropriate. GENERAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE WITHOUT PAY A general leave of absence without pay may be granted based on a documented request. The request for leave must be pre-approved by the department manager and is renewable for additional periods at the discretion of the division Vice President or, if unavailable, the Chief level officer. The following steps must be followed when requesting leave without pay: 1. Employee completes the _Leave without Pay \u2013 Negative Time Request Form_ and submits it to their supervisor. This form can be found in the Human Resources section of the intranet. 1. For non-emergency situations, the _Leave without Pay \u2013 Negative Time Request Form_ must be completed at least one (1) month prior to the date the employee wishes to begin leave. 2. Where the leave of absence is based on an emergency, the employee or a family member should contact the employee\u2019s supervisor as soon as possible and follow-up with a completed _Leave without Pay \u2013 Negative Time Request Form_ within five (5) days of the beginning of the leave. 2. The supervisor and divisional vice president approve or decline the request. 3. The employee is notified of the decision by their supervisor. 4. The form is sent to Human Resources for processing. While an employee is out of work on a general leave of absence without pay, the Credit Union will maintain whatever benefits the employee was enrolled in prior to the leave for up to 30 days, provided the employee makes arrangements and continues to pay their portion of the premiums for such insurance. Paid time off balances must be exhausted prior to requesting leave without pay. ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE Employees as a group may be granted paid Administrative Leave for inclement weather, other emergencies, etc. when authorized by the Chief Leadership Team (CLT), or a designee. Your supervisor will be advised when to grant Administrative Leave. Administrative Leave will be for a specific amount of time on a specific date. It is intended only for employees who are physically at work when the situation for Administrative Leave occurs. Administrative Leave is paid to employees who are at work and willing to complete their work shift, but due to AmeriCU\u2019s delayed opening or closing early (either Company-wide or at certain financial centers) cannot complete their shift. Hours paid to each employee are based on the employee\u2019s scheduled hours for the day minus the hours already worked. The hours paid to each employee may be different. If the Credit Union opts not remain open during a period of inclement weather, any employee who chooses not to report to work, or work remotely (with prior approval) due to weather related conditions will be charged a full day of PTO or it will be unpaid if the employee does not have any time remaining. Individuals who do not have the capability/approval to work remotely will be paid for the day with no reduction in accumulated PTO. Similar to other types of leave, Administrative Leave is not considered \u201cworked\u201d hours for the purpose of calculating overtime for the work week per the Fair Labor Standards Act requirements. Examples of how to assign Administrative Leave are posted on the intranet in the Knowledge Base. BLOOD AND BONE MARROW DONATION LEAVE Blood Donation Leave AmeriCU will provide eligible employees with up to three (3) hours of unpaid leave in any twelve (12) month period for the purpose of donating blood, provided they submit appropriate documentation demonstrating that they used the time to donate blood. This leave must be requested in advance and employees may choose to use their paid time off in lieu of unpaid leave. Requests for more than three (3) hours are subject to supervisory approval. Bone Marrow Donation Leave The Credit Union will permit eligible employees to take up to three (3) hours of unpaid leave for off-premises bone marrow donation once per calendar year, provided they give reasonable notice and submit appropriate documentation showing that they used the time to donate blood. The Credit Union strictly prohibits any form of discrimination against employees who take time off for blood or bone marrow donation as provided for in this policy. Employees must report any suspected discrimination immediately to their immediate supervisors or to the Human Resources Department. VOLUNTEER EMERGENCY RESPONDERS LEAVE To provide job protection while an employee responds to an emergency situation, AmeriCU will grant unpaid time off to employees that serve as volunteer emergency responders during certain state and local emergencies as declared by the Governor or an appropriate local executive, provided the leave does not cause an undue hardship. Employees who are eligible for this leave include volunteer firefighters and volunteer ambulance service personnel who have provided to AmeriCU prior written documentation regarding their volunteer status or whose duties as a volunteer firefighter or member of a volunteer ambulance service are related to the declared emergency. Following an employee\u2019s return from such leave, the Credit Union may request a notarized statement from the head of the volunteer fire department or ambulance service certifying the period of time that the employee responded to the emergency. Employees may choose to use their available paid time off in lieu of unpaid leave for this time away. MILITARY LEAVE The Credit Union will provide military leaves of absence and reinstatement for qualifying employees in accordance with applicable state and federal law, including the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). Leaves are absence for members of the military will be unpaid, unless otherwise required by law. Advanced notice of military service is required unless military necessity prevents such notice. Employees may use available paid time off for such leave. MILITARY SPOUSE LEAVE Employees who work a minimum of twenty (20) hours per week and are a spouse of an active-duty military, National Guard or Reserve person are eligible for up to ten (10) days of unpaid leave while the military spouse, deployed during a period of military conflict to a combat theater or zone, is home on leave. Notice should be given as soon as possible. JURY DUTY To provide income protection while an employee carries out their civic responsibility, AmeriCU will pay employees summoned for jury duty, for the first five (5) days of jury service. Employees are required to provide a photocopy of their summons and the notice they receive to their supervisor proving they served time. This notice must be forwarded to Human Resources for the employee\u2019s file. Additional income-protected time away from the Credit Union for jury duty service will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Generally, beginning on the sixth day of jury service, the employee will receive the jury fee from the judicial system. Additionally, employees may choose, but are not required, to use their available paid time off for the balance of time served beyond the first five (5) days. If you are excused from jury duty for one-half (1/2) day or more, you are expected to return to work at the Credit Union. CRIME VICTIM / WITNESS LEAVE If an employee appears as a witness on behalf of the Credit Union, he/she will be excused from Credit Union duty and paid regular wages for the day. Any employee subpoenaed to appear as a witness will be granted an unpaid leave of absence. In addition, any employee who is a victim of a crime or who is subpoenaed to attend a criminal proceeding as a witness will be granted an unpaid leave of absence to appear as a witness, consult with the district attorney, and/or to exercise other rights under the law. The employees may choose, but is not required, to use their available paid time off during their absence. The employee must provide notice to their supervisor or to the Human Resources Department at least one day prior to taking leave. The employee may be required to provide verification of their service. The Company strictly prohibits any form of discrimination or retaliation against an employee who takes leave as provided for under this policy. Employees must report any suspected discrimination immediately to their supervisor or to Human Resources. LEAVE FOR VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AmeriCU will, absent undue hardship, provide an employee who is a victim of domestic violence with time off from work for a reasonable period of time for any of the following reasons: Seeking medical attention for injuries caused by domestic violence, including for a child who is victim of domestic violence, provided that the employee is not the perpetrator of the domestic violence against the child; Obtaining services from a domestic violence shelter, program, or rape crisis center as a result of domestic violence; Obtaining psychological counseling related to an incident or incidents of domestic violence, including for a child who is a victim of domestic violence, provided that the employee is not the perpetrator of the domestic violence against the child; Participating in safety planning and taking other actions to increase safety from future incidents of domestic violence, including temporary or permanent relocation; or Obtaining legal services, assisting in the prosecution of the offense, or appearing in court in relation to the incident or incidents of domestic violence. Employees requesting time off for these reasons must provide AmeriCU with reasonable advance notice of their absence, unless advance notice is not feasible. If advance notice is not feasible, the employee must, within a reasonable period of time after the absence, provide AmeriCU with one of the following types of certification: A police report indicating that the employee or their child was a victim of domestic violence; A court order protecting or separating the employee or their child from the perpetrator of an act of domestic violence; Other evidence from the court or prosecuting attorney that the employee appeared in court; or Documentation from a medical professional, domestic violence advocate, health care provider, or counselor that the employee or their child was undergoing counseling or treatment for physical or mental injuries or abuse resulting in victimization from an act of domestic violence. Employees requesting time off under this policy will be required to utilize all accrued paid time off prior to taking time off without pay. An employee with a physical or mental disability resulting from domestic violence can request reasonable accommodations and will be treated in the same manner as any other employee with a disability. To the extent permitted by law, AmeriCU will maintain the confidentiality of information regarding an employee\u2019s status as a victim of domestic violence. Employees with questions about this policy are encouraged to contact Human Resources. TIME OFF TO VOTE AmeriCU encourages all employees to fulfill their civic responsibilities and to vote in all official public elections. Generally, shift schedules will provide employees with enough time to cast their vote before or after working hours. If you have four (4) consecutive hours either between the opening of the polls and the beginning of your shift, or between the end of your working shift and the closing of the polls, you have sufficient time to vote outside of your working hours. If an employee who is a registered voter does not have sufficient time to vote in a covered election, the Company will permit the employee to take off so much working time as will, when added to their voting time outside of working hours, enable the employee to vote. However, the Credit Union will not compensate you for more than two (2) hours of this time. You must take this leave at the beginning or end of your shift, whichever the Credit Union designates, unless you and the Credit Union agree to another time. If an employee wishes to take time off to vote, the employee must notify their supervisor not more than ten, nor less than two working days before the day of the election. Employees will not be discriminated or retaliated against for taking time off to vote. However, employees who utilize time off under this policy for any purpose other than voting will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination. FAILURE TO RETURN TO WORK FROM ANY LEAVE OF ABSENCE If an employee does not return to work on the assigned date at the end of their approved leave of absence and does not obtain advance approval from Human Resources for a longer leave, AmeriCU will assume the employee has resigned and their employment will be terminated. Further, if an employee fails to provide proper notice to not return to work; he/she will forfeit any PTO hours. BENEFITS AND RELATED TOPICS EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS SUMMARY AmeriCU has established a variety of employee benefits programs designed to assist you and your eligible dependents in meeting the financial burdens that can result from illness, disability, and death and to help you plan for retirement. Some benefits ( _e.g._ , workers\u2019 compensation insurance) are mandated by law, while others are offered voluntarily by AmeriCU. This handbook only provides a general description of the benefits. The health insurance plan and certain other benefit plans are described more fully in the master plan documents and summary plan description (SPD) booklets, which you will receive once you are eligible to participate in these programs. Complete descriptions of our insurance plans are also in AmeriCU\u2019s master insurance contracts with our insurance carriers, which are maintained in Human Resources. If information in this Handbook contradicts or conflicts in any way with the terms or information in these SPD booklets, master plan documents or insurance contracts, then the SPD booklets, master plan documents, or contracts shall govern and control in all cases. AmeriCU reserves the right to amend or terminate any of its benefit programs or to require or increase employee premium contributions toward any of its benefits at its discretion. This reserved right may be exercised in the absence of financial necessity. AmeriCU further reserves the right to change its contribution level towards premium costs on an individual basis.

A comprehensive 401(k) Plan has been designed to provide you with the opportunity to develop a meaningful retirement benefit. HEALTH, DENTAL AND VISION INSURANCE Employees who regularly work at least twenty (20) hours per week and are not temporary employees, may choose to participate in the currently available group medical, dental and/or vision plans. Employees become eligible to enroll in these plans as of the first of the month following their hire date. Employees who would like to change their current coverage or elect new coverage may do so during the annual open enrollment period. Employees who experience a qualifying event such as a birth, divorce, death, marriage, etc. may elect or change coverage outside of the open enrollment and within thirty (30) days of the qualifying event. Employees pay the premium costs via a pre-tax payroll deduction. CONSOLIDATED OMNIBUS BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT (COBRA) The federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) provides the opportunity to continue current health and dental insurance coverage for a prescribed amount of time to those who would otherwise lose their health coverage(s) due to a qualifying event. Some common qualifying events are resignation, termination of employment, death of an employee, an employee\u2019s divorce or legal separation, and a dependent child who no longer meets eligibility requirements. Under COBRA, qualifying participants pay either the full cost, or a percentage of the cost, of their current health coverage(s) at AmeriCU\u2019s current group rates. The cost charged to qualifying participants will be according to current requirements of the act. An administration fee, as allowed by the act, will apply. Applicable COBRA notices will be sent to eligible employees and/or their dependents when and as required by the act. If you have any questions regarding COBRA, please see a member of the Human Resources Department. WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION Workers\u2019 Compensation is insurance paid for by the Credit Union. It provides for medical care and/or compensation to employees who are injured or become ill as a direct result of their job. If you are injured during the course of your work for the Credit Union, you must immediately report your injury to your supervisor. Supervisors should immediately report the situation to Human Resources Department so proper on- going care and the workers\u2019 compensation claim can be managed appropriately. LIFE INSURANCE AmeriCU provides group Basic Term Life and Accidental Death and Dismemberment insurance to all active full-time employees at no cost. All employees, with the exception of temporary hires, who work more than twenty (20) hours per week can purchase, at their own expense, additional term life insurance for themselves and their dependents. SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DISABILITY An employee may be eligible to receive weekly disability benefits through our disability plans if they are unable to work because of a non-work-related injury or illness. Under the Short-Term Disability program, a certain percentage of the employee\u2019s average weekly wages, up to a certain maximum, may be reimbursed per week. Depending on the disability, this plan can continue for up to twenty-six (26) weeks. In the event that an employee collects both state mandated short-term disability and benefits under the New York State Paid Family Leave Benefits Law (\u201cPFL\u201d) at different times during the same 52-week rolling backward period, the maximum amount of time that can be taken for both short-term disability and PFL combined is 26 weeks. A full-time employee becomes eligible for Long-Term Disability after sixty (60) days of regular, full-time active employment. Full-time employees may be eligible to participate in our Long-Term Disability plan if their disability continues past twenty-six (26) weeks. Long-Term Disability benefits are paid on a monthly basis. Short and Long-Term Disability claims are processed, approved/denied and administered by our insurance carrier. Employees do not accrue paid time off while out on disability leave. Employees are responsible for paying all applicable payroll deductions while out of work on disability leave. Please contact Human Resources with questions. VOLUNTARY INSURANCES All employees, with the exemption of temporary hires, can purchase for themselves and their dependents, at their own expense: Vision Insurance; Specified Disease and Accident policies; and Voluntary Life Insurance. EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AmeriCU recognizes that the skills and knowledge of its employees are critical to the success of the organization. Our educational assistance program is designed to assist employees in their professional development. It also encourages personal development through formal education so employees can maintain and improve job-related skills. AmeriCU will provide eligible employees with financial assistance, subject to limitations and pre-approval, for courses, certification programs, and examinations requested of employees by management or voluntarily taken by employees. The courses, programs, and examinations covered under this policy must meet certain criteria established by AmeriCU and requests for financial assistance must be submitted and approved by certain deadlines to qualify. The higher-level educational assistance program is open to full-time employees after completing one year of service. The program is also subject to change at any time when deemed necessary by management. While successful completion of a course of study improves an employee\u2019s educational background, such accomplishment does not obligate the organization to reward participants with continued employment, promotion, transfer, reassignment, compensation increase, or other employment-related benefits. For complete eligibility requirements, rules and program details please refer to the Education Assistance Program policy located in the Knowledge Base on the intranet.

In order to receive holiday pay, the holiday must fall on a regularly scheduled workday. Full-time and part-time employees, who are normally scheduled to work at least twenty (20) hours per week, will receive holiday pay provided they work their complete scheduled workday immediately before and after the holiday. In exceptional cases and with VP or above written approval, failure to work the full day before or after a holiday may be excused. Additional documentation may be required by HR in accordance with applicable law. If any unscheduled time ( _i.e._ , call-in, personal, leave early, arrive late, etc.) is used for your scheduled day(s) immediately before and/or after a holiday, you will not be paid for the holiday unless such time is covered by FMLA, PFL, or New York Paid Sick Leave. However, you may use your accrued paid time off to make up for the lost holiday pay. If you do not have any paid time off available this time would be unpaid, you will not be allowed to go into a negative. Holiday hours will be paid at the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay. Holiday hours do not count toward overtime hours. Holiday pay is paid as follows: Full-time employees receive 8 hours per holiday, part-time 30-39 hours receive 6 hours per holiday, part-time 20-29 hours receive 4 hours per holiday and employees who work less than 20 hours or are considered temporary are not eligible for holiday pay. Paid Holidays during PTOs, Weekends and Leaves of Absence: If a holiday occurs during an employee\u2019s PTO, holiday hours will be paid instead of PTO hours. If a Credit Union-recognized holiday falls on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday), it will not be paid unless it is recognized during the regular workweek (Monday \u2013 Friday). Holiday pay will not be paid to employees on an unpaid leave of absence when the holiday occurs. PAID TIME OFF (PTO) Paid Time Off (PTO) It is in the best interest of both the Credit Union and employees that time off is planned and taken. PTO is tracked on a calendar basis and is front loaded at the beginning of each year. All PTO requests are approved based on business needs which is determined by management.

PTO will be carried over from year to year, but employees are not permitted to use more than the amount of annual PTO Hours Awarded set forth above. Termination of Employment and Paid Time off Pay: We expect employees who resign from AmeriCU to conduct themselves in a professional manner and to provide notice of voluntary resignation in accordance with this policy to allow the organization to plan for its staffing needs. All employees are expected to provide two (2) weeks\u2019 advance notice of voluntary resignation or retirement and to work through the notice period unless their supervisor sets an earlier end date. Paid time off may not be used during the notice period, unless such time is being used for a legally protected absence. An employee who provides the applicable amount of advance notice and works through the notice period will be paid their accrued, unused PTO time upon termination. An employee who fails to provide the applicable amount of advance notice and/or who fails to work through the applicable notice period will forfeit all unused, accrued PTO time upon termination. Additionally, employees who are involuntarily terminated will not be paid their accrued PTO upon termination. PAID SICK LEAVE New York\u2019s Paid Sick and Safe Leave Law (NY PSL) requires employers provide paid sick leave for eligible employees. The Credit Union\u2019s PTO policy meets or exceeds any leave that an employee would otherwise be entitled to under the New York Paid Sick Leave Law, and therefore PTO hours are inclusive of PSL hours. Employees who are not eligible for personal time under the Credit Union\u2019s personal time policy will accrue paid sick leave for use in accordance with this policy. Accrual of Paid Sick Leave Part-time, temporary, seasonal, and per diem employees who are not eligible for the Credit Union\u2019s PTO will accrue Paid Sick Leave beginning on their date of hire at a rate of one (1) hour of paid sick leave for every thirty (30) hours worked, up to a maximum of fifty-six (56) hours of paid sick leave per calendar year. Paid sick leave will be available for use as it is accrued. Paid sick leave can be used in any increment and will be paid at the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay. Carryover Employees can carryover accrued, unused paid sick leave into the next calendar year. However, employees cannot use more than fifty-six (56) hours of paid sick leave in any calendar year. Reasons for Leave Eligible employees may use paid sick leave for any of the following reasons: 1. The mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition of the employee or the employee\u2019s family member, regardless of whether such illness, injury, or health condition has been diagnosed or requires medical care at the time that such employee requests such leave, as well as the diagnosis, care or treatment of the same; 2. An absence from work when an employee or an employee\u2019s family member has been the victim of domestic violence, a family offense, sexual offense, stalking, or human trafficking, including leave to: 1. Obtain services from a domestic violence shelter, rape crisis center, or other services program; 2. Participate in safety planning, temporarily or permanently relocate, or take other actions to increase the safety of the employee or the employee\u2019s family members; 3.

Take any other actions necessary to ensure the health or safety of the employee or the employee\u2019s family member, or to protect those who associate or work with the employee. An employee who committed the domestic violence, family offense, sexual offense, stalking, or human trafficking (and was not a victim) is not eligible for leave under this Section 2, nor may this leave be used on behalf of an employee\u2019s family member who has engaged in any of these infractions. For purposes of this policy, \u201cfamily member\u201d is defined as an employee\u2019s child (including biological child, adopted child, foster child, a legal ward, or a child for whom the employee stands \u201cin loco parentis\u201d), spouse, domestic partner, parent (including biological parent, foster parent, step-parent, adoptive parent, legal guardian, or an individual who stood \u201cin loco parentis\u201d to the employee as a minor child), sibling, grandchild or grandparent, and the child or parent of an employee\u2019s spouse or domestic partner. All other terms are defined in accordance with the New York Paid Sick Leave Law. Notice Requirements The Company requests notice of the need for paid sick leave as soon as possible, but in all cases, notice must be given prior to taking paid sick leave. Notice can be given orally or in writing to the employee\u2019s supervisor. Documentation Requirements Where permissible by law, employees may be required to provide documentation or an attestation verifying that the use of paid sick leave complies with the New York Paid Sick Leave Law. Restoration to Employment At the conclusion of an employee\u2019s use of paid sick leave, the employee will be returned to the employee\u2019s previously held position. Separation from Employment An employee will not be paid for accrued, unused paid sick leave upon an employee\u2019s separation from employment. Retaliation Any form of discipline, reprisal, intimidation, retaliation, or discrimination against any individual for requesting or taking paid sick leave under this policy or for filing a complaint for violations of this policy is strictly prohibited. The Credit Union is committed to enforcing this policy and prohibiting retaliation against employees who request or take paid sick leave under this policy or who file a related complaint. If employees feel that they or someone else may have been subjected to conduct that violates this policy, they should report it immediately to the Human Resources Department. Interaction with Other Types of Leave Time off taken under this policy will run concurrently with leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), paid family leave, and short-term disability whenever applicable. Please refer to those policies for details regarding the use of paid sick leave. Employees who have used up their available paid sick leave and remain unable to report for work may be eligible for FMLA, paid family leave or short-term disability. Please refer to those policies for details. Questions Employees with questions about this policy are encouraged to consult with the Human Resources Department. BIRTHDAY LEAVE On January 1st each year, in celebration of your birthday, you will be given birthday leave as a floating holiday to be used anytime during the calendar year. Newly hired employees will earn birthday leave after completion of their ninety (90) day orientation period. Employee regularly scheduled to work a part-time schedule of 20-29 hours will receive 4 hours of birthday leave, those regularly scheduled to work 30-39 hours will receive 6 hours of birthday leave and full-time employees regularly scheduled to work 40 hours per week will receive 8 hours of birthday leave. The hours do not carry over into the next year and will not be paid out to an employee under any circumstances. BEREAVEMENT LEAVE Employees are provided with paid time off for attending the funeral or memorial service of a member of their immediate family. A maximum of five (5) consecutive days off paid at your regular base rate of pay is permitted upon the death of your spouse, child or stepchild. A maximum of three (3) consecutive days off paid at your regular base rate of pay is permitted upon the death of your: Brother or sister includes stepbrother or stepsister. Parent or legal guardian includes Stepmother and Stepfather. Own grandparents; and Mother or father in-law. A maximum of one (1) day off per calendar year paid at your regular base rate of pay for the death of any immediate family member not covered above. Bereavement leave for part-time employees will be paid at your regular base rate of pay accordingly: Four (4) paid hours per day of leave for employees regularly scheduled to work 20-29 hours Six (6) paid hours per day of leave for employees regularly scheduled to work 30-39 hours Employees who regularly work less than twenty (20) hours per week are not eligible for this benefit. The following factors will be considered in determining whether an employee will receive pay for bereavement leave: Employee should request a bereavement leave of absence as soon as the death of an immediate family member is known. Bereavement allowance will not be paid unless the employee gives as reasonable as practicable prior notice of intended absence from scheduled work and the time and date they intend to return to work. Bereavement leave must be taken in consecutive days, unless death and funeral service are separated beyond this time frame. Bereavement allowance will be paid only for scheduled work time lost and will not be counted in computing overtime. Proof of relationship to the deceased and/or documentation of the death ( _e.g._ , death certificate, obituary, documentation from funeral home) may be required. An employee in need of extra time off for bereavement may request to take paid time off or unpaid leave if other leave is depleted. This extra time off must be requested prior to the need and approved by the employee\u2019s supervisor and the Human Resources Department. PAID PRENATAL LEAVE The Credit Union will provide eligible employees with paid prenatal leave in accordance with this policy and applicable law. Eligible employees will be provided with twenty (20) hours of paid prenatal leave during any 52-week calendar period. This is based on a rolling 52-week calendar period running from the first time the employee takes any paid prenatal leave in accordance with this policy. Paid prenatal leave may only be taken for health care services received by an employee during their pregnancy or related to such pregnancy, including physical examinations, medical procedures, monitoring and testing, and discussions with a health care provider related to the pregnancy. Paid prenatal leave can be used for fertility treatment or care appointments, including IVF, as well as end-of-pregnancy care appointments. Paid prenatal leave must be taken in hourly increments and will be paid in hourly installments. Paid prenatal leave will be paid at the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay. Employees that intend to utilize or otherwise need to utilize paid prenatal leave are required to provide advance notice by notifying Human Resources. The Credit Union encourages employees to make a good faith effort to schedule appointments in a manner that is least disruptive to the Credit Union\u2019s operations, if possible. Because paid prenatal leave is available on a rolling 52-week basis, unused paid prenatal leave does not technically carryover to the following year. Any unused paid prenatal leave will be forfeited upon an employee\u2019s separation from employment. The Credit Union will not require the disclosure of confidential information related to an absence from work for this purpose as a condition of providing paid prenatal leave. Employees will not be discharged, threatened, penalized, or in any other manner discriminated or retaliated against because an employee has exercised their rights, including requesting or using paid prenatal leave in accordance with this policy and the applicable law. AWARDS AND INCENTIVES At times employees may, at the sole discretion of the Credit Union, be granted an award or incentive for outstanding performance, completing a special task or an achievement reflecting favorably upon the employee or the Credit Union. Per IRS guidelines, all awards, incentives and gift cards are subject to employer and employee taxation except service awards. Milestone Awards Service awards for regular status employees are calculated on years of service, excluding breaks in service, and may be presented to employees on their milestone anniversaries (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 etc.). These awards recognize their achievements and contributions as valuable members of the team and recognize the difference they make in helping AmeriCU achieve its vision of \u201cproviding our members the right financial products to live life, dream big and achieve financial success.\u201d APPENDIX A \u2013 HARASSMENT/DISCRIMINATION REPORTING FORM This form is designed to assist individuals making a report under the AmeriCU\u2019s (the \u201cCredit Union\u201d) Sexual Harassment and Discrimination Prevention Policy (the \u201cPolicy\u201d).

This plan goes into effect when an airborne infectious disease is designated by the New York State Commissioner of Health as a highly contagious communicable disease that presents a serious risk of harm to the public health. This plan is subject to any additional or greater requirements arising from a declaration of a state of emergency due to an airborne infectious disease, as well as any applicable federal standards. _Employees should report any questions or concerns with the implementation of this plan to the designated contact._ This plan applies to all \u201cemployees\u201d as defined by the New York State HERO Act, which means any person providing labor or services for renumeration for a private entity or business within the state, without regard to an individual\u2019s immigration status, and shall include part-time workers, independent contractors, domestic workers, home care and personal care workers, day laborers, farmworkers and other temporary and seasonal workers. The term also includes individuals working for digital applications or platforms, staffing agencies, contractors or subcontractors on behalf of the employer at any individual work site, as well as any individual delivering goods or transporting people at, to or from the work site on behalf of the employer, regardless of whether delivery or transport is conducted by an individual or entity that would otherwise be deemed an employer under this chapter. The term does not include employees or independent contractors of the state, any political subdivision of the state, a public authority, or any other governmental agency or instrumentality. As of the date of the publication of this document, while the State continues to deal with COVID-19 and a risk still exists, no designation is in effect at this time. Please check the websites of Departments of Health and Labor for up-to-date information on whether a designation has been put into effect, as any such designation will be prominently displayed. No employer is required to put a plan into effect absent such a designation by the Commissioner of Health. 1.

EXPOSURE CONTROLS DURING A DESIGNATED OUTBREAK 1. MINIMUM CONTROLS DURING AN OUTBREAK During an airborne infectious disease outbreak, the following minimum controls will be used in all areas of the worksite: General Awareness: Individuals may not be aware that they have the infectious disease and can spread it to others. Employees should remember to: Maintain physical distancing; Exercise coughing/sneezing etiquette; Wear face coverings, gloves, and personal protective equipment (PPE), as appropriate; Individuals limit what they touch; Stop social etiquette behaviors such as hugging and hand shaking, and Wash hand properly and often. \u201cStay at Home Policy\u201d : If an employee develops symptoms of the infectious disease, the employee should not be in the workplace. The employee should inform the designated contact and follow New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance regarding obtaining medical care and isolating. Health Screening : Employees will be screened for symptoms of the infectious disease at the beginning of their shift. Employees are to self-monitor throughout their shift and report any new or emerging signs or symptoms of the infectious disease to the designated contact. An employee showing signs or symptoms of the infectious disease should be removed from the workplace and should contact a healthcare professional for instructions. The health screening elements will follow guidance from NYSDOH and CDC guidance, if available. Face Coverings : To protect your coworkers, employees will wear face coverings throughout the workday to the greatest extent possible. Face coverings and physical distancing should be used together whenever possible. The face covering must cover the nose and mouth, and fit snugly, but comfortably, against the face. The face covering itself must not create a hazard, e.g. have features that could get caught in machinery or cause severe fogging of eyewear. The face coverings must be kept clean and sanitary and changed when soiled, contaminated, or damaged. Physical Distancing : Physical distancing will be followed as much as feasible. Avoid unnecessary gatherings and maintain a distance of at least six feet (or as recommended by the NYSDOH/CDC for the infectious agent) from each other. Use a face covering when physical distance cannot be maintained . _In situations where prolonged close contact with other individuals is likely, use the following control methods: (Note to employer: Check off the controls you intend to use and add any additional controls not listed here.)_ restricting or limiting customer or visitor entry; limiting occupancy; allowing only one person at a time inside small enclosed spaces with poor ventilation; reconfiguring workspaces; physical barriers; signage; floor markings; telecommuting; remote meetings; preventing gatherings; restricting travel; creating new work shifts and/or staggering work hours; adjusting break times and lunch periods; delivering services remotely or through curb-side pickup; and restricting communal food. Hand Hygiene: To prevent the spread of infection, employees should wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol to clean hands BEFORE and AFTER: touching your eyes, nose, or mouth; touching your mask; entering and leaving a public place; and touching an item or surface that may be frequently touched by other people, such as door handles, tables, gas pumps, shopping carts, or electronic cashier registers/screens. Cleaning and Disinfection : See Section V of this plan. \u201cRespiratory Etiquette\u201d : Because infectious diseases can be spread by droplets expelled from the mouth and nose, employees should exercise appropriate respiratory etiquette by covering nose and mouth when sneezing, coughing or yawning. Special Accommodations for Individuals with Added Risk Factors : Some employees, due to age, underlying health condition, or other factors, may be at increased risk of severe illness if infected. Please inform your supervisor or the HR department if you fall within this group and need an accommodation. 2. ADVANCED CONTROLS DURING AN OUTBREAK For activities where the Minimum Controls alone will not provide sufficient protection for employees, additional controls from the following hierarchy may be necessary. Employers should determine if the following are necessary: Elimination : Employers should consider the temporary suspension or elimination of risky activities where adequate controls could not provide sufficient protection for employees. Engineering Controls : Employers should consider appropriate controls to contain and/or remove the infectious agent, prevent the agent from being spread, or isolate the worker from the infectious agent. Examples of engineering controls include: 1. Mechanical Ventilation: 1. Local Exhaust Ventilation, for example: Ventilated booths (lab hoods); Kitchen Vents; and Vented biosafety cabinets. 2. General Ventilation, for example: Dedicated ventilation systems for cooking areas, malls, atriums, surgical suites, manufacturing, welding, indoor painting, laboratories, negative pressure isolation rooms; Increasing the percentage of fresh air introduced into air handling systems; Avoiding air recirculation; Using higher-efficiency air filters in the air handling system; If fans are used in the facility, arrange them so that air does not blow directly from one worker to another; and 2. Natural Ventilation, for example: Opening outside windows and doors to create natural ventilation; and Opening windows on one side of the room to let fresh air in and installing window exhaust fans on the opposite side of the room so that they exhaust air outdoors. _(Note: This method is appropriate only if air will not blow from one person to another.)_ 3. Install automatic disinfection systems (e.g., ultraviolet light disinfection systems). 4. Install cleanable barriers such as partitions and/or clear plastic sneeze/cough guards. 5. Change layout to avoid points or areas where employees may congregate (e.g., install additional timeclocks). Subject to changes based on operations and circumstances surrounding the infectious disease, engineering controls that are anticipated to be used are listed in the following table: Engineering Controls Utilized/Location --- HVAC systems are serviced, filters changes, and coils are cleaned 4x's a year for large RTU's, 2x's for smaller systems and as needed during outbreaks. All systems are adjusted to maximize outside air circulation into the buildings. Interior air intakes are cleaned and sanitized. NOTE - opening windows/doors is not an option for our organization given security Requirements of banking facilities. _Note to Employer: One of the best ways to reduce exposure to infectious agents is to improve ventilation. The aim is to deliver more \"clean air\" into an occupied area and exhaust the contaminated air to a safe location. In some cases, the air may have to be filtered before it enters the work area and/or before it is exhausted. Direct the contaminated air away from other individuals and from the building's fresh air intake ports. Consult your ventilation system's manufacturer or service company to determine if improvements are possible for your system._ \u200b\u201cAdministrative Controls\u201d are policies and work rules used to prevent exposure. Examples include: Increasing the space between workers; Slowing production speed to accommodate fewer workers at a time; Disinfecting procedures for specific operations; Not shaking out soiled laundry; A-7 Employee training; Identify and prioritize job functions that are essential for continuous operations; Cross-train employees to ensure critical operations can continue during worker absence; Limit the use of shared workstations; Post signs reminding employees of respiratory etiquette, masks, handwashing; Rearrange traffic flow to allow for one-way walking paths; Provide clearly designated entrance and exits; Provide additional short breaks for handwashing and cleaning; and Establishing pods or cohorts working on same shift. Subject to changes based on operations and circumstances surrounding the infectious disease, the following specific administrative controls are anticipated to be used: Administrative Controls Utilized/Location: --- Depending on the severity of the situation, the majority of the employees will switch to remote workstations. We can also increase the space between workers; utilize plexi-glass shields, limit the use of shared spaces ( _i.e._ , break rooms/conference rooms). Provide training on protocols. We will open interior doors to cut down on the doorknob usage. Other options include A/B cohorts to ensure less people in our offices. As noted above, we can also prioritize job functions that are essential for continuous operations. Post needed signage for masks, distancing, hand washing, mask wearing, etc. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) are devices like eye protection, face shields, respirators, and gloves that protect the wearer from infection. PPE will be provided, used and maintained in a sanitary and reliable condition at no cost to the employee.The PPE provided to an employee will be based on a hazard assessment for the workplace. PPE Required - Activity Involved/Location --- AmeriCU has a substantial supply of PPE on hand and will maintain supplies for future airborne issues. We have plexi-glass shields for our member facing employees. We have a supply of anti-bacterial spray and cleaning materials for all of our offices. 1. _The use of respiratory protection, e.g. and N95 filtering facepiece respirator, requires compliance with the OSHA Respiratory Protection Standard 29 CFR 1910.134 or temporary respiratory protection requirements OSHA allows for during the infectious disease outbreak._ 2. _Respirators with exhalation valves will release droplets from the respirators. Respirators are designed to protect the wearer. Surgical masks and face covering, which are not respirators, are designed to protect others, not the wearer._ 3. EXPOSURE CONTROL READINESS, MAINTENANCE AND STORAGE: The controls we have selected will be obtained, properly stored, and maintained so that they are ready for immediate use in the event of an infectious disease outbreak and any applicable expiration dates will be properly considered. 3. HOUSEKEEPING DURING A DESIGNATED OUTBREAK 1. Disinfection Methods and Schedules Objects that are touched repeatedly by multiple individuals, such as door handles, light switches, control buttons/levers, dials, levers, water faucet handles, computers, phones, or handrails must be cleaned frequently with an appropriate disinfectant. Surfaces that are handled less often, or by fewer individuals, may require less frequent disinfection. The disinfection methods and schedules selected are based on specific workplace conditions. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have compiled lists of approved disinfectants that are effective against many infectious agents (see dec .ny.gov and epa .gov/pesticide-registration/selected-epa-registered-disinfectants ). Select disinfectants based on NYSDOH and CDC guidance and follow manufacturer guidance for methods, dilution, use, and contact time. 2. Adjustments to Normal Housekeeping Procedures Normal housekeeping duties and schedules should continue to be followed during an infectious disease outbreak, to the extent practicable and appropriate consistent with NYSDOH and/or CDC guidance in effect at the time. However, routine procedures may need to be adjusted and additional cleaning and disinfecting may be required. Housekeeping staff may be at increased risk because they may be cleaning many potentially contaminated surfaces. Some housekeeping activities, like dry sweeping, vacuuming, and dusting, can resuspend into the air particles that are contaminated with the infectious agent. For that reason, alternative methods and/or increased levels of protection may be needed. Rather than dusting, for example, the CDC recommends cleaning surfaces with soap and water before disinfecting them. Conducting housekeeping during \u201coff\u201d hours may also reduce other workers\u2019 exposures to the infectious agent. Best practice dictates that housekeepers should wear respiratory protection. See cdc.gov for more guidance. 3. If an employee develops symptoms of the infectious disease at work, it is ideal to isolate the area in accordance with guidance issued by NYSDOH or the CDC, before cleaning and disinfecting the sick employee\u2019s work area. This delay will allow contaminated droplets to settle out of the air and the space to be ventilated. 4. As feasible, liners should be used in trash containers. Empty the containers often enough to prevent overfilling. Do not forcefully squeeze the air out of the trash bags before tying them closed. Trash containers may contain soiled tissue or face coverings. 4. INFECTION RESPONSE DURING A DESIGNATED OUTBREAK If an actual, or suspected, infectious disease case occurs at work, take the following actions: Instruct the sick individual to wear a face covering and leave the worksite and follow NYSDOH/CDC guidance. Follow local and state authority guidance to inform impacted individuals. 5. TRAINING AND INFORMATION DURING A DESIGNATED OUTBREAK 1. The Incident Response Team will verbally inform all employees of the existence and location of this Plan, the circumstances it can be activated, the infectious disease standard, employer policies, and employee rights under the HERO Act. ( _Note:_ training need not be provided to the following individuals: any individuals working for staffing agencies, contractors or subcontractors on behalf of the employer at any individual work site, as well as any individual delivering goods or transporting people at, to or from the work site on behalf of the employer, where delivery or transport is conducted by an individual or entity that would otherwise be deemed an employer under this chapter.) 2. When this plan is activated, all personnel will receive training which will cover all elements of this plan and the following topics: the infectious agent and the disease(s) it can cause; the signs and symptoms of the disease; how the disease can be spread; an explanation of this Exposure Prevention Plan; the activities and locations at our worksite that may involve exposure to the infectious agent; the use and limitations of exposure controls; and a review of the standard, including employee rights provided under Labor Law, Section 218-B. 3. The training will be provided at no cost to employees and take place during working hours. If training during normal work hours is not possible, employees will be compensated for the training time (with pay or time off); appropriate in content and vocabulary to your educational level, literacy, and preferred language; and verbally provided in person or through telephonic, electronic, or other means. 6. PLAN EVALUATIONS DURING A DESIGNATED OUTBREAK The employer will review and revise the plan periodically, upon activation of the plan, and as often as needed to keep up-to-date with current requirements. Document the plan revisions below: Plan Revision History --- Date | Participants | Major Changes | Approved By | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 7. RETALIATION PROTECTIONS AND REPORTING OF ANY VIOLATIONS No employer, or their agent, or person, acting as or on behalf of a hiring entity, or the officer or agent of any entity, business, corporation, partnership, or limited liability company, shall discriminate, threaten, retaliate against, or take adverse action against any employee for exercising their rights under this plan, including reporting conduct the employee reasonably believes in good faith violates the plan or airborne infectious disease concerns to their employer, government agencies or officials or for refusing to work where an employee reasonably believes in good faith that such work exposes him or her, other workers, or the public to an unreasonable risk of exposure, provided the employee, another employee, or representative has notified the employer verbally or in writing, including electronic communication, of the inconsistent working conditions and the employer\u2019s failure to cure or if the employer knew or should have known of the consistent working conditions. Notification of a violation by an employee may be made verbally or in writing, and without limitation to format including electronic communications. To the extent that communications between the employer and employee regarding a potential risk of exposure are in writing, they shall be maintained by the employer for two years after the conclusion of the designation of a high risk disease from the Commissioner of Health, or two years after the conclusion of the Governor\u2019s emergency declaration of a high risk disease. Employer should include contact information to report violations of this plan and retaliation during regular business hours and for weekends/other non-regular business hours when employees may be working.

As a general matter, AmeriCU employees will be permitted to use AI Tools at AmeriCU only in circumstances when they enhance or assist the AI Users in performing their job-related tasks by enhancing productivity, efficiency, and decision-making, and only when the specific AI Tool has either been expressly approved by the Technology Steering Committee (as explained herein) or met the minimum criteria established by such committee. AmeriCU employees are cautioned that AI Tools, even those that are expressly approved, may produce erroneous or nonsensical results that are not real or do not match any data the algorithm has been trained on. In addition, the results may reflect biased or incomplete data sets on which the AI was trained, and may also produce biased results even when trained on neutral data. For this reason, it is critical that AI Tools should not be used blindly and should never be relied upon as the exclusive source of information regarding any important inquiry(ies). SCOPE This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who interact with, develop, or implement AI tools within the credit union (collectively, AI Users). It covers all AI technologies, including, but not limited to, machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. DEFINITIONS 1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is any technology, including Generative AI and / or Algorithmic AI, which can create new content in response to prompts, including but not limited to text, speech, and images (e.g., ChatGPT), or analyze data with machine-learning algorithms or large language models to take actions, or make decisions or predictions based on the input data. 2. Technology Steering Committee a duly-chartered committee of appropriate stakeholders from the credit union who, among other things, addresses the credit union's use of AI on a periodic basis and establish rules governing the use of AI, including this policy. 3. AI Tool is any application, software, or system that can independently change its own analytical methods and utilizes artificial intelligence (including Generative and Algorithmic AI), machine learning, large language models, transformers, or other advanced algorithms to perform tasks, analyze data, or make (or assist in making) decisions. 4. AI User is any person making use of any AI Tool in the course of the work day or in furtherance of any of their job responsibilities. RESPONSIBILITY 1. Technology Steering Committee shall be responsible for setting rules governing the use of AI by the credit union, its employees, vendors, and contractors, including specific rules regarding when a member's non-public personal identifying information may be input into an AI Tool. The Technology Steering Committee shall do so on a routine basis in whatever manner is appropriate, and shall at least annually review and approve this policy. 2. Human Resources shall be responsible for ensuring that all AmeriCU employees review and acknowledge this Policy at least once annually. Human Resources shall also be involved in any disciplinary action taken for a violation of this Policy. 3. Legal and Compliance shall be responsible for all vendor management functions required by this policy, and for advising on any legal or compliance related AI risks or matters. 4. Individual Employees Any AmeriCU employee using an AI Tool shall be ultimately and solely responsible for the accuracy and fairness of information produced by the tool, including any errors produced thereby. POLICIES 1. MINIMUM CRITERIA FOR USE OF AI TOOLS AT THE CREDIT UNION 1. The Technology Steering Committee shall prepare minimum criteria which must be satisfied prior to the use of any AI Tool by AmeriCU, its employees, vendors, or contractors. Shall criteria shall address at least the following: 1. The relative necessity of any vendor-provided AI Tool to undergo the credit union's existing third-party risk management (vendor management) regime; 2. Rules and/or standards regarding the data life cycle of any data input to, or output from, an AI Tool including, where appropriate: (A) the necessity of \"explainability\" (i.e., the ability of the AI Tool and / or the credit union to explain the AI Tool's outputs, which may be accomplished by after-the-fact auditing, if appropriate) and (B) the ownership of all such data; 3. Rules regarding confidentiality and the safeguarding of non-public personal identifying information, and other credit union-held confidential or proprietary information; 4. Rules regarding the relative need for the independent review of AI outputs by a human being, as well as circumstances where AI users may reasonably rely upon an expressly approved AI Tool's output; 5. Separate rules, as might be appropriate, for the use of \"open\" AI Tools versus \"closed\" AI Tools; 6. Any other criteria the Technology Steering Committee may deem appropriate or proper. 2. USE OF AI TOOLS 1. Expressly Approved AI Tools Without providing an exhaustive list of the same, as of the date of publication of this policy, the only AI Tools that are expressly approved for use by the credit union are: Microsoft Copilot, Posh / Glia, and Illuma Labs. 1. Please note, the fact an AI Tool is expressly approved does not mean it has been confirmed to be fair or unbaised. Unless the Technology Steering Committee has indicated AI Users are entitled to rely upon an AI Tool's outputs without further review, AI Users are ultimately responsible for the accuracy of the data they utilize or rely upon, and that the fact an AI produced inaccurate or biased data will not automatically excuse the employee from consequences that result from using the data. Additionally, AI Users must at all times comply with all AmeriCU's other policies and procedures when using AI Tools (e.g., fair lending, equal employment opportunity, confidentiality rules, etc.). Please refer to those policies for additional information on what might be considered inappropriate or unlawful use. 2. Expressly Prohibited AI Tools Tools that are expressly prohibited by the Technology Steering Committee may not be used by any employee for any reason when that employee is performing work functions for the credit union. The use of any such expressly prohibited AI Tool for any work purpose will subject the AI User to discipline, up to and including termination. As of the publication of this policy, the use of ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Apple Intelligence, or any of their derivatives, is expressly prohibited. 3. AI Tools that are Neither Expressly Approved nor Expressly Prohibited Tools falling into this category may be utilized by the credit union only after they are approved by the Technology Steering Committee. If any AI User is unsure whether the proposed use of an AI Tool is approved, that AI User shall first inquire with the Technology Steering Committee. 4. Use in HR Matters No AI User may use AI Tools to make suggestions regarding any person's employment status (e.g., hiring, terminating, promoting, disciplining, etc.) without the express written consent of the Technology Steering Committee, who shall first ensure it has consulted with HR prior to approving the use of any such AI Tool. 5. Suspension of use of AI Tools The Technology Steering Committee may, in its sole and absolute discretion, suspend the credit union's use of any AI Tool at any time for any reason the committee deems appropriate. 6. Personal Use of AI Tools in the Workplace To ensure compliance with applicable privacy laws and prevent reputational risk, if an AI User uses any AI Tool for non-work-related purposes during working hours, they may be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of employment or termination of contract (as in the case of a contractor or third-party vendor). 3. TRAINING 1. If directed by the Technology Steering Committee, Human Resources shall come up with periodic training and may require that AI Users receive training, either in-house or through a third-party vendor, concerning the potential benefits and risks associated with using AI Tools and on the operation and use of approved AI Tools. 2. If AmeriCU does require such training, AI Users must comply with any associated requirements (e.g., attendance and satisfaction of certain skills assessments) before they can access and use AI Tools for work-related purposes. 4. CONFIDENTIALITY 1. Member I nformation To ensure compliance with applicable law, non-public personal identifying information concerning AmeriCU's members should never be input into any AI Tool that is not expressly approved by the Technology Steering Committee for such a purpose. 2. Other Sensitive Information Other sensitive information may be input into any expressly approved AI Tool. In this regard, the AI User is expected to utilize usual prudence and discretion when ascertaining whether inputting the information into the expressly approved AI Tool will comport with the criteria of the Technology Steering Committee and this policy. 5. VIOLATIONS 1. Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract (as in the case of a contractor or third-party vendor). Nothing herein shall modify the at-will nature of an employee's employment with the Company. 6. AMENDMENT OF THESE POLICIES 1. AI technology and the laws and regulations governing AI are rapidly evolving and these policies may be amended from time to time by the Technology Steering Committee to reflect the evolving landscape.

The purpose of and goal of this policy is to provide consistency and conformity in the creation of user and service accounts. SCOPE The scope of this policy will apply to all parties that will access AmeriCU infrastructure, both remote and on-site, MTS, Information Security, Human Resources, Vendors. DEFINITIONS 1. User Accounts: Each system which requires a user account to grant access has its own methods and guidelines which MTS must adhere to when creating and/or changing user accounts by referring to Active Directory User Procedure. Please refer to these systems when looking for further detail on account creation and change. Human resources will contact MTS of access create or changes via a ticket. 2. Service Accounts: 1. What is a Service Account? A service account is a Windows user identity that is associated with a service executable for the purpose of providing a security context for that service. More broadly, we can say that service accounts are used not only for Windows services, but also for many enterprise applications. In addition, applications that leverage service accounts may grant additional permissions on top of the OS system privileges. For this reason, it is imperative that a service account not be used for interactive logon. The \u201cDeny logon locally\u201d is a Group Policy Object (GPO) setting that should be used for all service accounts because it shuts down one avenue of exploitation\u2014an interactive logon (e.g., a logon using Ctrl+Alt+Del) to a system with that account. Most security teams oppose the allowance of accounts with non-expiring passwords to exist, however exceptions to this may exist. One of the biggest concerns people have been the account could be used anywhere on the network, leading to abuse of it. The GPO and restricted login destinations will help secure these accounts. RESPONSIBILITY 1. MTS \u2013 will be responsible for creating, suspending, and deactivating accounts in Active Directory 2. Information Security \u2013 will be responsible for auditing active directory accounts on a regular basis 3. Human Resources \u2013 will be responsible for notifying MTS/Information Security of account creation, suspension, and disabling, with the exclusion of vendor accounts 4. Vendors \u2013 will be vetted through the Vendor Management process. The vendor will receive an account from AmeriCU once validated. Vendor accounts will expire after 12 months and will need to be reverified through the annual vendor risk evaluation 5. ACCESS REQUEST 1. Account requests will be started with a ticket from Human Resources. The requested access with be provided with the levels outlined for the Service Desk based on the user\u2019s role, which provides the minimum access for the user to perform job responsibilities. Additional access will require another ticket request from the user\u2019s manager. 6. ACCESS TERMINATION/TRANSFER/UPDATES 1. Account termination and transfer will require a ticket from Human Resources. The ticket should indicate which user will be impacted, their new title or change needed, and in the case of a termination, the last day of work. 2. In the event of an unfriendly termination, it is recommended that Human Resources contacts a member of MTS management. This notification will indicate a swift disabling of an account is needed or a need to do so just before the employee is notified of dismissal. 3. In the event of a _friendly termination_ the same notification process will be used as outlined above for account termination. Human Resources will help obtain AmeriCU equipment to include, but not limited to keys, laptop, monitors, desktop, Meraki device, cell phone, etc. In addition, temporary access will be provided to the stated user or manager for business continuity. 4. Access to AmeriCU content from inside and outside the infrastructure, is provisioned via a Virtual Private Network allowance. In any of the mentioned scenarios, disabling said account through Active Directory, Microsoft 365, and/or Azure, will render the access to AmeriCU content disabled. 5. MTS will automatically provide access to email, files and voicemail to the supervisor or their designate for 90 days. 6. After 90 days the account will be deleted with no retention of data unless approved by the CRO and/or CIO. 7. Every quarter the MTS management and Information Security management will review disabled accounts to ensure proper deletion or exceptions have been performed.

ACCOUNT RESTRICTIONS. Access to products and services may be restricted while a loan is in a past due stage, depending on the level of severity. Refer to the Collection Strategy document for details. 6. FOLLOW UP ACTION. Effective follow-up requires constant attention and proper system usage. A promise-to-pay will be created upon successful contact and discussion. When a full payment will not be received by the system due date, a promise-to-pay will be created. The team will closely monitor these accounts to verify that payments are made as promised. 7. MEMBER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. When members are not able to pay the originally agreed upon payment, it may be in the best interest of the Credit Union to work out special arrangements to keep the loan performing positively. These arrangements may include, but are not limited to, extensions, modifications, and refinancing. The borrower\u2019s ability and intent to repay will be evaluated separately as part of the plan, depending on the hardship, and used to make the final determination. 8. REPOSSESSION, FORECLOSURE OR ABANDONMENT. We will give members reasonable opportunities to cure deficiencies before recommending repossession or other action. There are generally two choices when collection efforts fail: taking and selling collateral or abandoning the collateral and suing the debtor for a monetary judgment. Sometimes the Credit Union can do both. For example, in the case of a loan secured by an automobile, we may repossess the automobile, sell it at a private or public sale, and then sue for the deficiency. The Credit Union will also consider and comply with the ACU-03-017 Military & Servicemembers Lending Policy, when applicable. 1. Repossession. Voluntary surrenders and involuntary repossessions will be approved by a member of the Credit Solutions leadership team. They will be executed by reputable agencies who are willing and able to proceed in a professional and cost-effective manner. All agencies must be bonded, licensed, and insured in the event of damage or liability resulting from agency action per normal vendor procedures. Repossession procedures shall adhere to accepted financial institution practices, including appropriate notice, inspection, and resale. 2. Foreclosure. Foreclosures on security interests in real estate will commence only after the member receives proper notice and the Credit Union has first evaluated the feasibility of a loan modification. All foreclosures will be handled by Credit Union legal counsel in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 3. Abandonment. The decision to abandon collateral will be approved by a member of the Credit Solutions leadership team and utilized only when the value of the collateral does not justify the cost to locate, pick up and re-market. 9. BANKRUPTCY. When the Credit Union receives notice of bankruptcy, the Credit Union will do the following: 1. Bring an immediate halt to any and all collection procedures already underway. 2. Stop any repossession, foreclosure or legal action. 3. Complete all necessary forms and forward these forms, along with the bankruptcy notice, to the assigned attorney for possible claim. 10. LEGAL ACTION. In general, legal action against a member will only occur after all other avenues of collection have been explored, and the potential for counterclaims has been examined. No suit shall be initiated without first sending a final demand notice, by regular mail. The Credit Union will not utilize this communication to deceive the member with false action. The Credit Union will only use this communication when pursuing actual legal action against the member or forwarding for further action with a collection agency. All legal actions will be authorized by the Credit Solutions leadership.

We understand that a certain percent of the loans granted will not be repaid. This policy governs the process by which the Credit Union will charge-off certain loans. SCOPE Board of Directors, Credit Union Management as detailed in ACU-01-004 Approval/Authority Limits Policy, Credit Solutions DEFINITIONS N/A RESPONSIBILITY 1. IDENTIFYING LOANS FOR CHARGE-OFF. The Credit Union will charge off certain loans when the _Board of Directors_ and _management_ deem them to be uncollectible. Please refer to the procedure for specifications and criteria for charging off loans. 2. _Credit Solutions_ will prepare a loan charge-off report monthly. Credit risk, delinquency, and charged-off loans will be monitored by _Credit Solutions_ on an ongoing basis. 3. The _Board of Directors_ designates the authority to charge off loans to _Credit Union Management_. Please refer to ACU-01-004 Approval/Authority Limits Policy for details. When a charge off constitutes a conflict of interest, such as loans to family members, such loans should be referred to the Board of Directors for action and approval. 4. LOSS REDUCTION. When permitted by the applicable loan agreements and when deemed appropriate by management, the Credit Union will reduce the amount of loan loss by: 1. Repossessing, foreclosing and liquidating collateral prior to the charge-off, including collateral covered by a cross-collateralization agreement. 2. Using shares and deposits of the borrower to offset the loan balance, where allowed by law. 3. Extending or refinancing the delinquent loan in accordance with Credit Union policies and procedures. As a general rule, the Credit Union will solicit loss mitigation options to the borrower(s) during the collection life cycle in an effort to keep the loan viable and performing. These options will be monitored for successful outcomes and will be generally limited to six instances over the life of the loan, unless an exception is made by the Credit Solutions leadership team. 5. FUTURE COLLECTION. It is the policy of the Credit Union to continue collection efforts after a loan is charged off. The cost of collection will be weighed against the potential recovery. Collection of charged-off loans may be handled internally or assigned to an outside agency at the discretion of management. The Credit Union will use all legal and available remedies to protect its interests and recover loan losses. 6. PERIODIC REVIEW. The _Board of Directors_ will periodically review the Credit Union's compliance with this loan charge-off policy and make appropriate recommendations when necessary.

The Board has instructed Management to establish a robust risk management process to ensure that the risk associated with such relationships are in line with expectations, and our risk tolerance and profile. The credit Union will actively seek out third party relationships to capitalize on a range of opportunities. These relationships can enhance our product and service offerings, improve earnings, increase efficiency, reduce costs. Entering a third-party relationship creates a level of risk, dependent upon the overall relationship. The risk associated with each relationship demands the need for oversight. The purpose of this policy is to outline the overall Third-Party Management Program for AmeriCU Credit Union, documenting the controls and the methodology of risk rating the third-party vendors. SCOPE This policy applies to AmeriCU Credit Union's Board of Directors, Chief Leadership Team (\"CLT\"), Legal Operations Department, Information Security Department, Center of Excellence (\u201cCoE\u201d), Member Technology Services Department (\u201cMTS\u201d), and all other AmeriCU Business Units and their personnel entering into relationships with third-party vendors. DEFINITIONS Third-Party: A person and/or entity the credit union utilizes to provide products, services, or materials to the credit union. Fourth Party : A person, vendor, or entity to which AmeriCU does not have a direct contract, or relationship but may provide services, products, or materials indirectly through our third-party vendor. A fourth party is our vendor\u2019s vendor and is also sometimes called a subcontractor. Vendor Management : The process of gathering and reviewing documentation about the risk measures third and fourth parties have in place to mitigate and monitor the risks they present. Through this process, the credit union can assess whether the third or fourth party is an appropriate business partner. Request for Proposal : Request for Proposal (\u201cRFP\u201d) is a competitive proposal process whereby AmeriCU solicits proposals from potential vendors. The RFP Process is used when the desired outcome is known, but it is difficult to define the methodology, exact materials or services required to achieve the desired results, or the different offerings in the market are variable. Know Your Business (\u201cKYB\u201d) : A term capturing the requirement that each AmeriCU employee charged with managing a relationship with a third or fourth party have a sufficient level of knowledge regarding the third or fourth party to conduct effective Vendor Management. RESPONSIBILITY 1. AmeriCU Credit Union's Board of Directors. Responsible for oversight and approval of the Third-Party Risk Management Program. Annually review and approve the Third-Party / Vendor Risk Level Classifications (see below) by approving this policy, in its then-current form. Approve or delegate approval of critical vendors. 2. AmeriCU Credit Union's CLT . Responsible for managing third-party relationships and the risks that they pose. This is done through a series of assessments and controls managed by Legal Operations. 3. CoE. In conjunction with Legal Operations, ascertain when an RFP is required. Evaluate RFPs. In conjunction with Legal Operations, sometimes lead projects including onboarding of new vendors/products. 4. MTS. Perform MTS Feasibility Evaluations. Monitor data connections. Monitor system interfaces. 5. Legal Operations. In conjunction with the CoE, ascertain when an RFP is required. Assess, measure, monitor and control the risk associated with third-party anf fourth party relationships at onboarding, offboarding, and on an ongoing basis in between, and advise department personnel regarding the same. Define critical vendors through risk assessment within TPRM vendor software, and approve the same after appropriate due diligence has been conducted and satisfied Legal Operations that doing business with the vendor is a prudent business decision with appropriately managed risk considering all the surrounding circumstances. Notify vendors at start of offboarding and work with Department personnel to ensure offboarding is complete. Responsible for maintaining a Vendor Management procedure consistent with this Policy. 6. Information Security. Collaborate with Legal Operations, and others, to review the soundness of a third or fourth party\u2019s information / physical security controls, SSAE-18 (SOC 1 or SOC2) or other regulatory certifications (as applicable), and business continuity and disaster recovery plans, including their effectiveness, at both onboarding, and an ongoing basis throughout the vendor lifecycle. Collaborate with Legal Operations, and others, at third or fourth party offboarding to ensure the credit union\u2019s data is properly recovered or destroyed, as the case may be, and that user login credentials are appropriately removed. 7. Compliance. Collaborate with Legal Operations to conduct due diligence on particular vendors' compliance with applicable law. 8. AmeriCU Department personnel. Perform KYB and due diligence on vendors. Work with Legal Operations to assess, measure, monitor, and control risks. Policy Exclusions 1. The following exclusions apply to the TPRM program: 1.

Certain subscriptions: magazines, books, newspaper, digital content, social media websites, etc. 8. Certain other relationships, as determined by Legal Operations in the prudent exercise of its discretion. THIRD PARTY / VENDOR RISK LEVEL CLASSIFICATIONS Before entering a contract with a third party / vendor, the Credit Union will assess the associated services and products provided, to assign the appropriate third-party risk level, or tier, based on what the third-party relationship provides to the Credit Union. A crucial aspect of a successful risk management program involves the implementation of a robust and a consistent methodology for determining which activities and third-party relationships pose increased risk and require a more thorough level of supervision and oversight. The following definitions are utilized to assess and assign the criticality level of third-party relationships. Tiers 1 \u2013 5 cover the vast majority of third-party relationships in everyday business. Tiers 5-10 are used to identify third-party relationships where the nature of the third-party justifies a specialized approach to vendor management: TIER 1 ( _Critical_ ): Third parties / vendors providing services considered \u201ccritical\u201d to the Credit Union. These third parties may: Have significant member impacts that would cause material harm to members if the third party fails to meet expectations. Transmit and store confidential or protected information of Credit Union\u2019s members on a frequent basis; or Have a significant impact on the Credit Union\u2019s financial condition or operations. TIER 2 ( _GLBA_ ): Third parties / vendors whose activity does not qualify as Tier 1 but have access to member protected data. These third parties provide services that may expose the Credit Union to levels of risk, which require the Credit Union to conduct a consistent review of applicable controls on an ongoing basis. These third parties may have access to GLBA data, or be involved with the storage of encrypted personal, non-public information of the Credit Union members. These relationships are more easily replaced, without significant disruption to Credit Union operations or member service. TIER 3 ( _Infrastructure_ ): Third parties / vendors that provide a service necessary for the Credit Union to operate, but do not have access to GLBA protected data. These third parties may be responsible for communication, data protection and/or electricity. TIER 4 ( _Moderate_ ): Third parties that perform a useful function but provide services that could be easily replaced by another third party without disruption to the Credit Union\u2019s operations or member service. They provide services that may expose the Credit Union to moderate levels of risk, but the Credit Union has significant control or influence over these risks. These relationships do not typically have access to the personal, non-public information of Credit Union members. TIER 5 ( _Low_ ): All other third-party relationships not included in the above Tier assignments. Services of the third parties in this category include those considered incidental to the Credit Union\u2019s operations and are easily replaced with little or no disruption to services. The third party does not have access to confidential member data. Little or no financial losses would result from the third party\u2019s failure to adequately manage risk. TIER 6 ( _Appraisers_ ): These third parties are licensed or certified appraisers who perform appraisal services for the Credit Union, or the Credit Union\u2019s members, in relation to a real estate transaction. These relationships provide services that may expose the Credit Union to moderate levels of risk, but the Credit Union has significant control or influence over these risks. Additionally, the Credit Union has special oversight requirements imposed by fair lending laws. These third parties do not typically have access to the personal, non-public information of Credit Union members. TIER 7 ( _Title Companies_ ): These third parties procure title policies and perform closing / settlement services for the Credit Union or the Credit Union\u2019s members in conjunction with a real estate transaction. These relationships provide services that may expose the Credit Union to moderate levels of risk, but the Credit Union has significant control or influence over these risks. These third parties may have access to the personal, non-public information of Credit Union members. TIER 8 ( _Financial Institutions_ ): These are financial institutions with whom the Credit Union deals for the purposes of loan servicing, participation loans, correspondent purposes, and other banking functions. They are federally regulated financial institutions pursuant to FRB Regulation F or state institutions regulated by applicable state law. If the services provided by another Financial Institution may be difficult to replace in a seamless manner, due to volume and overall reliance, it may need to be elevated to the Critical third party / vendor tier. TIER 9 ( _Professional_ ): Third parties that provide professional services licensed by the state or federal government and are governed by strict privacy and other legal regulations. They may have incidental or low frequency access to member information during the delivery of professional services. These relationships provide services that may expose the Credit Union to moderate levels of risks, and include law firms, certified accounting firms, and professional auditors. TIER 10 ( _Government_ ): This includes Government agencies that provide particularized services to the Credit Union, and/or federal, state, and local branches of government with whom the Credit Union has a relationship. Services provided are highly regulated. The Credit Union understands the risks involved in working with a government institution and monitors for any material changes that might affect the Credit Union.

AmeriCU has determined that Absence from the Office of Five Consecutive Business Days is sufficient as an internal control safeguard due to both the Physical and Digital Absence from the Office (as defined herein) that will be implemented, and the Compensating Risk Controls and Mitigants identified in this Policy. Penalties for failing to comply with this policy are set forth in the related procedure, and include, without limitation, being required to select an alternate period of Five Consecutive Business Days to utilize as an employee\u2019s Absence from the Office, or any other available discipline, up to and including termination from employment. New employees hired from October 1st to December 31st in a given year are not required to comply with this policy because they may not have sufficient paid time off available. Such employees shall be required to comply with this policy in the next calendar year following their year of hire. SCOPE This 5 days away policy applies to all employees of the Credit union. DEFINITIONS DFS: Department of Financial Services Sensitive Position: A Sensitive Position is defined by the New York Department of Financial Services to include any officer or employee: 1. Having the ability to change the official books and records or transactions of the organization, and those who can influence others to change such books and records or transactions; 2. With privileged access to information systems, including the authority to alter systems, such as an IT manager; and 3. Engaged in certain specialized products that pose a higher risk to the Regulated Banking Organization. After reviewing the job responsibilities of all officers and employees at AmeriCU, the Credit Union has determined that all officers and employees of the Credit Union serve in Sensitive Positions. Absence from the Office: Absence from the Office constitutes both Physical and Digital absence. 1. Physical absence shall consist of refraining from any and all access to any non-public areas of AmeriCU buildings or facilities. Employees will remain permitted to access public areas in their capacities as AmeriCU members to perform transactions. Thus, employees may use the teller line, ITMs, etc., but only in their capacity as an AmeriCU member. 2. Digital absence shall consist of refraining from accessing any AmeriCU electronic system including, but not limited to, email, digital work calendar, electronic messaging systems, phone systems, or VPN access. Accordingly, unlike AmeriCU\u2019s prior policy, reading email or listening to voicemail is not permitted. Length of Absence: The Length of the Absence shall be Five Consecutive Business Days, and can include any combination of PTO, holiday, conference training, or other approved leave. An unplanned medical leave that meets the time requirement may also qualify as long as both Physical and Digital Absence from the Office, as defined in this Policy, are maintained. Five Consecutive Business Days: Five Consecutive Business Days means five consecutive days the employee would work, and can be carried over two consecutive weeks. For example: Thursday, Friday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Saturday can be included if it was a day the employee would have otherwise worked on a normal schedule, or if the employee\u2019s job responsibilities sometimes include Saturdays. Sundays cannot be included. Compensating Risk Controls and Mitigants: AmeriCU utilizes numerous controls that monitor both member-initiated and internally initiated transactions, and which serve as Compensating Risk Controls and Mitigants. These consist of at least the following: dual control for the completion of internal financial transactions; the separation of duties between transactors and balancers; the implementation of review processes for large transactions and transactions on dormant accounts; the review of audit logs for anomalies across multiple systems; the implementation of the principal of \u201cleast privilege\u201d for employees accessing digital systems, meaning that employees receive the minimum digital access permissions required to perform their job functions and do not have access to systems they do not actually use; automated detections for large amounts of moved, deleted, or modified data; automated detections for abnormal actions such as users accessing stale data, or system administrators performing unusual actions such as resetting passwords or creating new, highly privileged accounts; the implementation of conditional access policies related to when and how employees can connect remotely or use email or other digital systems on both company and non-company devices; the use of multi-factor authentication for account access, both off network access and privileged account access (such as by system administrators); and audit logs for Windows systems are sent to security information event management systems for evaluation against threat rules. RESPONSIBILITY 1. Each individual AmeriCU employee is responsible for notifying Human Resources of the Five Consecutive Business Days the employee intends to utilize to comply with this Policy. As set forth in the Procedure related to this Policy, Absent extenuating circumstances, the employee must notify Human Resources _before_ the Absence from the Office commences. A failure to do so will result in the employee being informed they must select a different Five Consecutive Business Day period. 2. Risk Management shall be responsible for maintaining this policy, and for monitoring and validating that each AmeriCU employee in a Sensitive Position maintained their physical and digital Absence from the Office. 3. Information Security shall be responsible for assisting Risk Management with the monitoring of individual employees\u2019 compliance with this policy. 4. Human Resources shall maintain a list of the Absence from the Office taken by each AmeriCU employee in a Sensitive Position, including any exceptions authorized as described both herein, and in the procedure related to this policy. 5. Member Technology Services shall be responsible for forcibly logging each AmeriCU employee in a Sensitive Position out of all devices during the Absence from the Office. 6. Business Unit and Financial Center Managers shall be responsible for notifying the C-Team Member for their business unit should the need arise for an individual employee to have an exception to this policy. 7. Chief Leadership Team shall be responsible for approving any exceptions to this policy on a case-by-case basis. In any such case, the approving C-Team Member shall notify Human Resources of the exception. As set forth more fully in the procedure related to this policy, no C-Team Member may approve his or her own exception. The President & Chief Executive Officer shall have the authority to approve exceptions for other C-Team Members. 8. Board of Directors shall be responsible for approving any exception to this policy related to the President & Chief Executive Officer.

None of these factors are to be used in determining loan amounts, interest rates, the duration, extensions or any other circumstances regarding the extension of consumer and real estate- related loans. Moreover, the CU will not discriminate based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap, familial or marital status, sexual orientation or age of the owner, occupant or lessee of a dwelling being financed. The CU will use its standard credit factors in the loan decision process. Credit denials will be based solely on income, length of employment, credit history, collateral adequacy, availability of funds and other neutral credit factors. All officers and employees in all lending areas of the CU, public contact areas and audit will have a working knowledge of the provisions of the ECOA- Regulation B, the Fair Housing Act, HMDA- Regulation C, NCUA Non- discrimination Requirements (NCUA Rules and Regs 701.31), HUD 24 CFR Part 100, ADA (28 CFR 1630) and NYS Law- Chapter 18 Executive, Article 15 Section 296-A . The purpose of the CU\u2019s Fair Lending Policy is to promote the availability of credit to all credit-worthy members without regard to any of the prohibited basis. SCOPE _This policy applies to all employees, officers, directors, and third parties acting on behalf of AmeriCU Credit Union in connection with credit activities, including but not limited to the origination, underwriting, servicing, and collection of loans._ DEFINITIONS CU- Credit Union HUD- U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ECOA- Equal Credit Opportunity Act HMDA- Home Mortgage Disclosure Act NCUA- National Credit Union Association ADA- Americans With Disabilities MSA- Metropolitan Statistical Area LEP- Limited English Proficiency Control Group- group of applicants or borrowers who may have been treated more favorably in the credit decisioning, servicing, or pricing process. For analytical purposes our Control Group is comprised of applicants that are: White and Non-Hispanic, Male or Joint (Male and Female), Middle and Upper Income, and located in non-Minority tracts and Middle to Upper Income Tracts. RESPONSIBILITY _The responsibility for implementing and maintaining this Fair Lending Policy lies with the Chief Risk Officer and the Board of Directors. The Chief Lending Officer will ensure that all employees involved in the lending process adhere to the standards outlined in this policy._ 1. PROHIBITED ACTIVITY 1. No officer, employee or other agent of the CU will discourage any applicant from applying for or seeking credit on the grounds of any prohibited basis. All applications, whether individual or business, written or oral, in person, virtual or by telephone, will be similarly and fairly evaluated on aspects other than the prohibited basis. Any application evaluation system used by the CU will not discriminate among applicants by using any of the prohibited basis as variables. Moreover, the CU will not discriminate on the basis of any of the prohibited factors in any aspect of the loan application, servicing or collection processes. 2. As required by the ECOA and the Fair Housing Act, the CU may not, because of a prohibited factor: Fail to provide information or services or provide different information or services regarding any aspect of the lending process, including credit availability, application procedures or lending standards. Discourage or selectively encourage applicants with respect to inquiries about an application for credit. Refuse to extend credit or use different standards in determining whether to extend credit. Vary the terms of credit offered, including the amount, interest rate, duration or type of loan. Use different standards to evaluate collateral.

Express, orally or in writing, a preference for or against protected applicants. Discriminate because of a person associated with a credit application. Discriminate because of the present or prospective occupants of the area where property to be financed is located. 3. This policy extends (as applicable) to relationships with third party vendors such as mortgage brokers, automobile dealerships, home improvement contractors, and debt collectors. Additionally, all such relationships must be governed by written contracts, to include language whereby the vendor agrees to adhere to all \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bFair Lending requirements. 2. PROTECTED CLASSES 1. The following classes are protected by fair lending regulations and will not be factors considered in the lending process: Race, Color, Religion, Sex (including sexual orientation and /or gender identity) National Origin, Age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract), Marital or Family Status (including same-sex marriage), Disability, Receipt of Public Assistance, the Exercise of Rights Under the Consumer Credit Protection Act, or Handicap. 3. TYPES OF LENDING DISCRIMINATION 1. Overt discrimination is intentional discrimination on a prohibited basis. 2. Illegal disparate treatment is a form of discrimination that may arise when a lender treats an applicant less favorably than a similarly situated applicant on the basis of a prohibited characteristic, and there is no credible, non-discriminatory explanation for the difference in treatment. 3. Illegal disparate impact arises when a neutral policy or practice disproportionately affects a protected class, and there is no credible, non-discriminatory business justification. 4. Redlining is a type of disparate treatment that involves unequal access to credit or terms based on where they live and any prohibited characteristics that make up the primary population of the area, even if they qualify for the loan. 5. Reverse Redlining is an illegal predatory practice that targets specific low income or minority neighborhoods that make up the population of an area for unfair credit terms. 4. TRAINING 1. The CU has established a training program to give all lending, board of directors and public contact personnel exposure to the laws and regulations with which they will deal as an employee of the CU, especially those personnel with responsibility for processing and/or underwriting loans. The goal of the training program is to assist personnel to better understand the fair lending laws appropriate and relative to each employee's responsibilities. The program will: Provide a basic understanding of the principals and core elements of these laws. Provide annual training and ongoing awareness to ensure the Fair Lending Policy and Procedures are being followed to ensure the CU staff are able to identify, report, and prevent discriminatory practices. 5. PROHIBITED ADVERTISING PRACTICES 1. The CU is prohibited from using any words, phrases, symbols or forms that might convey discriminatory preferences or limits when advertising consumer or residential property loans. This includes overt or tacit discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, family or marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin. 2. The following practices are considered discriminatory and may not be used in the CU\u2019s advertising: Limit marketing and advertising to a specific geographic area within the CU\u2019s field of membership. Use language selectivity (such as using only English in an area where the majority of the members or potential members are non-English-speaking). Exclude some media. Use billboard advertising that is placed only in certain demographic areas. Limit distribution of brochures within a selected zip code zone. Exclude specific types of human models in advertising for residential property loans. 3. The compliance department reviews all advertising and marketing materials for compliance with fair lending laws prior to publication or distribution to ensure they do not contain discriminatory content or practices. 6. NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS 1. TO NATURAL PERSON APPLICATIONS The CU is required to notify one of the applicants on the credit application of the CU\u2019s decision, favorable or adverse, with respect to a complete or incomplete application within 30 days of receipt of the application. A notice of favorable or adverse action will be provided. Notification of Favorable Action Notification is to be given in the form of a notice of the loan approval either verbally or by email and/or by execution of the loan documents and disbursement of the loan proceeds. Notification of Adverse Action Notification is to be given to the applicant in a written notice containing a statement of the action taken, the name and address of the CU, the ECOA notice contained in paragraph 1002.9(b)(I) of Regulation B, the name and address of the NCUA regional director, and a statement of the specific reasons for the action taken. 2.

FAIR LENDING AUDITING, MONITORING AND TESTING 1. Statistical Fair Lending Data Analysis- The CU conducts this analysis of the consumer, residential and commercial borrower data for any potential disparities. This in an internal quarterly self testing of the following items: Identify potential decision disparities- underwriting is tested by comparing similarly situated borrowers by comparing the differences in approval/denial rates of applicants among the control group and minority and prohibited basis group; Identify potential of less favorable rates, limits, down payments, or other payment terms- loans are tested for differences between our control group and the prohibited basis group or minority applicants; Identify levels of assistance-testing of decisions and final disposition is conducted by analyzing for differences between our control group and the prohibited basis group or minority applicants; Identify if potential evidence of Steering is occurring- testing is conducted by reviewing demographic information in comparison to less desirable or higher cost product;. Identify potential pricing differences- loan interest rates, fees, or points are tested for differences between our control group and the prohibited basis group or minority applicants; Redlining analysis is conducted by testing the amount of applications, declines or acceptances in the MSA compared to our peers in our market areas. The results of these tests are reviewed by the Fair Lending Committee for trends of patterns, areas of concern, and improvement opportunities. If any red flags are identified such as disparities in outcomes that reflect consistent differences that cannot be explained by risk factors such as credit scores or debt-to-income ratios then a root cause analysis will be conducted. This deeper dive into disparities will be conducted to understand the underlying causes to determine if policy, underwriting criteria, or unconscious bias may be contributing to the issue. Corrective Action will be based on the identified trends, recommended corrective actions may include changing loan policies, enhancing training on fair lending, a change in vendor, or adjusting marketing campaigns. This testing is deemed completed when the CU has obtained the results and made a determination about what corrective action, if any, is appropriate and the results of the testing has been reported to the CEO and board of directors. 2. Underwriting Decision and Policy Exception Testing- The CU conducts this fair lending loan review of underwriting and the loan approval process and decisions to ensure consistency and fairness. This is an internal monthly loan review that is selected by the Quality Control Department that is conducted by the Fair Lending Committee. The Committee compares similar situated borrowers for potential disparate treatment. Policy exceptions on loans are reviewed for potential disparity risks. Reference the Fair Lending Loan Committee Charter and Fair Lending Underwriting Testing Procedures for specifics. 3. Annual Fair Lending Audit- The Audit and Quality Assurance Coordinator, on behalf of the Supervisory Committee, is responsible to ensure the auditing of the lending function of the credit union. This will include an annual assessment of the adherence to fair lending laws. This assessment may be conducted by a third party as deemed necessary by the Supervisory Committee. 8. VENDOR DUE DILIGENCE 1. Third-party fair lending monitoring is an essential part of the CU fair lending compliance program. It ensures that vendors who provide lending-related services are aligned with the CU's fair lending practices and regulatory requirements. The steps involved include: Evaluate Vendors: Risk Assessments are conducted and identify which third-party vendors have direct or indirect impacting on lending activities, such as loan originators, appraisal services, data analytics, and loan servicing companies. Vendor Due Diligence: Review of vendors' fair lending policies and procedures to ensure they align with the CU standards. Examination of vendor's compliance history for prior fair lending violations or regulatory issues. Contractual Agreements: Ensure contracts with third-party vendors include specific clauses that hold them accountable for fair lending compliance. Ongoing Monitoring: In accordance with the Credit Union's third-party risk management policy and procedure, conduct periodic due diligence review of vendors to evaluate their compliance with fair lending practices. This involves providing a Fair Lending Questionnaire that evaluates the vendors adherence to fair lending requirements. 9. FAIR LENDING RISK ASSESSMENT 1. The fair lending risk assessment will be performed annually. This involves examining the risks based on the CU's market, products offered, and day to day operations. The assessment includes: assessing the pre-application activities, underwriting and pricing, servicing activities by market, delivery channel, product line, and evaluation of how the compliance management program is managing fair lending. 10. REPORTING OF INFRACTIONS 1. The Chief Risk Officer and/or Chief Lending Officer will report directly to the Board the results of the compliance program or when there is reason to believe infractions of the Fair Lending Policy may have existed or may currently exist in the lending practices of the CU. 11. FAIR LENDING COMPLAINT RESOLUTION 1. The Credit Union will ensure complaints received are evaluated in accordance with this policy. Complaints that allege a potential fair lending issue or discrimination will be escalated and reviewed by the Chief Risk Officer, Chief Lending Officer and the Supervisory Committee. The Credit Union will address each complaint in accordance with NY ST, Executive, Art. 15 \u00a7 296-A Section 296-a and its additional, New York-specific prohibited bases of discrimination. Complaints will be handled as follows: A fair and timely investigation will be conducted. Corrective actions will be taken if any violation of this policy is found. If any violation is found the results of the investigation and corrective action taken will be reported to senior management and the board of directors. 12. RECORD RETENTION 1. The following lending records will be retained in the CU for a period of 25 months: Loan applications along with processing details. Pre-screened Solicitations about the criteria used to select potential members. Real estate appraisals. Adverse action notices. Written statements alleging discrimination. 2. Retention of the Testing Analysis- The following self-test information must be retained for 25 months after it has been completed: Information regarding the scope of the test; The methodology used and the time period covered by the test; The report or results of the self-test, including any analysis or conclusions; and Any corrective actions taken in response to the self-test. 13. REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS 1. The CU will make reasonable accommodations for a member with disabilities when such accommodations are necessary to afford the member an equal opportunity to apply for credit. 14. LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY 1. Non-native English speakers have equal access to credit and loan services by ensuring that language barriers do not result in unequal treatment or denial of credit. This is accomplished by: All applicants, regardless of their language proficiency have access to utilize our language interpretation services provider. Employees are trained to recognize and avoid discriminatory practices related to language proficiency. Regular demographic analysis of our HMDA data and Metropolitan Statistical Area that we do business in to identify language needs is conducted with our quarterly Fair Lending Data Analysis. This analysis is used to determine the most common languages spoken by our applicants and in the MSA's that may require interpretation and/or materials to be offered in those languages. 15. POLICY REVIEW 1. This Policy will be reviewed and updated to comply with any changes or revisions to existing regulations that may affect the policy. The Chief Risk Officer and Chief Lending Officer assume responsibility for this compliance review and revision process to to ensure the effectiveness and compliance with current laws and regulations. Moreover, the Board will review the Policy annually to ensure it is relevant and updated as necessary.

AmeriCU, as part of its day-to-day business, contacts members for various reasons, including sales calls. This policy will outline how AmeriCU will comply with the TCPA. To remain compliant with TCPA, we must have sound procedures and practices. AmeriCU Credit Union will ensure that all covered phone calls and text messages comply with the requirements of the TCPA. SCOPE Any Member-Facing Staff DEFINITIONS AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE DIALING SYSTEM (AUTODIALER). The TCPA's definition is any technology which has the capacity to store or produce telephone numbers to be called using a random or sequential number generator to dial such numbers. Even if the Credit Union's system does not currently have the capacity or capability at this time to make these calls, the system would still be considered an \"autodialer\" if it had the capacity to be upgraded in the future to make these calls. TELEMARKETING. The initiation of a telephone call or message for the purpose of encouraging the purchase, rental or investment in property, goods, or services, which is transmitted to any person. UNSOLICITED ADVERTISEMENT. TCPA defines this to mean \"any material advertising the commercial availability or quality of any property, goods, or services, which is transmitted to any person without the person's prior express invitation or permission, in writing or otherwise.\" EXPRESS WRITTEN CONSENT. Credit Unions wishing to make calls and send text messages for telemarketing purposes should have express written consent. The consumer's express written consent complies with the following disclosure requirements. The consent is in writing bearing the signature of the consumer providing consent (written consent includes an electronic or digital form of signature pursuant to the E-SIGN Act); Clearly authorizes the Credit Union to call the consumer using an automatic telephone dialing system or prerecorded message for telemarketing purposes; and Is not a condition of purchasing goods or services. RESPONSIBILITY AmeriCU will have procedures in place to comply with the requirements of the TCPA including the guidelines above. Procedures will be comprehensive to avoid multiple calls and text messages being made or sent to reassigned/wrong numbers or to consumers who have opted out. Senders of advertisements via fax must provide specified notice and contact information on the facsimile that allows recipients to \"opt out\" of any future facsimile transmissions from the senders. Any artificial or prerecorded message telemarketing calls that could be answered by the consumer must provide an interactive opt-out mechanism that is announced at the outset of the message and is available for the duration of the call. The opt-out notice must be \"clear and conspicuous,\" meaning that it is \"apparent to a reasonable consumer.\" The Credit Union will identify a \"cost- free mechanism\" for a recipient to transmit an opt-out request. Such mechanisms can include a website address, e-mail address, toll-free telephone number or toll-free facsimile machine number, but need only include one mechanism. Local telephone numbers may be provided, so long as the advertisements are sent to local members for whom a call to that number would not result in long- distance or other separate charges. If a website is used to receive opt-out requests, the Credit Union will ensure that the first page of the site describes the opt-out mechanism and procedures clearly and conspicuously. Whichever mechanism is used, the Credit Union will ensure that opt-out requests can be accepted 24 hours, 7 days a week. AmeriCU will comply with opt-out requests as soon as possible. The Credit Union will also have procedures to avoid future calls being made to consumers who have opted out. The Board delegates to management the responsibility for developing procedures in accordance with this policy. It is the responsibility of management to update procedures when new legislation is introduced regarding TCPA. PRERECORDED MESSAGES. If the Credit Union leaves an artificial or prerecorded telephone message, the message begins by stating the identity of the Credit Union and the telephone number of the Credit Union, including a toll-free number for the consumer to opt-out of future calls. RESOURCES/REFERENCES TCPA rules can be found here: eCFR :: 47 CFR Part 64 Subpart L -- Restrictions on Telemarketing, Telephone Solicitation, and Facsimile Advertising. The TCPA is implemented by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and, unlike some regulations, the TCPA rules are interpreted and clarified through orders. As a result, credit unions cannot rely solely on the regulatory text because the FCC has issued several orders over the years clarifying and revising its TCPA rules.

To meet these ongoing objectives, the Board of Directors has adopted an audit policy. To further this policy, the Board of Directors endorses internal audit to establish audit procedures and to review, report, and recommend changes and improvements in credit union operations and policies. To carry out these responsibilities, the Board of Directors states that internal audit must: Remain independent of Credit Union operations. Be provided complete access to all necessary records. Receive employee assistance and cooperation when conducting audits. Receive timely and constructive responses to the audit reports from management. SCOPE Business Unit Managers, Senior Management, Audit and Quality Assurance Coordinator DEFINITIONS CPA - Certified Public Accountant Internal Audit- Audit and Quality Assurance Coordinator and External Audit Firms RESPONSIBILITY 1. The purpose and objectives of internal audit, as established by the Supervisory Committee and approved by the Board of Directors, will determine the responsibilities of the Audit & Quality Assurance Coordinator. These may include responsibilities from the Supervisory Committee, Management, and Members. A clear statement of responsibility from the Supervisory Committee and the Board of Directors is the foundation for an effective internal audit program. This Credit Union\u2019s Supervisory Committee and Board of Directors have stated their purpose in the internal audit charter. To fulfill the function of internal auditing, the normal responsibilities of the Audit & Quality Assurance Coordinator include: Assist the contracted third party internal audit firm in the completion of the audit plan. To periodically prepare and review the audit scope and audit plan that sets forth audit objectives and planned audit coverage with the Supervisory Committee, Board of Directors, and management. To develop an efficient and comprehensive program of internal audits that will accomplish the agreed-upon objectives. To conduct the audit program in a manner that will accomplish its objectives and goals, ensuring the use of, and monitoring progress of Audits using Audit systems. To conduct special examination procedures at the request of the Supervisory Committee, the Board of Directors, or management. To report results, conclusions, and recommendations and perform appropriate follow-up of recommendations or corrections being implemented ensuring the use of, and monitoring progress of Audits using the approved Findings system. To obtain optimum results from internal auditing, the Supervisory Committee, Board of Directors, and management have created an atmosphere conducive to an effective audit by taking the following steps: Prepared a policy statement that clearly indicates the existence, authority, and responsibility of the internal audit department. Coordinate Audit Department efforts with the Credit Union's contracted audit firms. 2. The independent external CPA firm is primarily concerned with rendering an opinion as to the fairness of the financial statements presented annually to the Supervisory Committee, Board of Directors, Management, and the Credit Union membership. This report will be available to all regulating entities. The Audit & Quality Assurance Coordinator provides assistance in evaluating the internal accounting controls. The Audit & Quality Assurance Coordinator and the independent outside auditors coordinate their activities, with oversight provided by the Supervisory Committee. Both evaluate internal controls and examine financial records. The independent outside auditors will periodically rely on work performed by the Audit and Quality Assurance Coordinator. 3. Duties include: Distribution of department questionnaires received from the examiners in preparation for their audit. Coordination of information between the examiners and department management. Making available internal audit department reports issued since the last examination. Requesting and/or preparing special reports needed for the examination. Providing periodic updates on the regulatory examination to the Supervisory Committee. 4. Security/Privacy Statement The purpose of this statement is to assure the Board of Directors and management that internal audit takes precautions to safeguard nonpublic personal information that is obtained in the course of an internal audit. Nonpublic information necessary to complete the audit will be secured at all times. The privacy regulation allows the sharing of information with Attorneys, Accountants and Auditors as defined in NCUA Section 716.15 (a)(3). As required in the normal course of business, results of audits will be shared with credit union examiners and the Certified Public Accounting Firm hired by the credit union on an ongoing basis. Request of all information from a third party, including external fraud, other than the affiliated parties such as examiner or external audit firms will require a subpoena. In addition to privacy, the internal audit department will ensure that records are locked during non-operating hours to limit the risk of non-public information and/or confidential department information from falling into the hands of others. 5. The Board of Directors sponsors the Supervisory Committee, which is made up of Credit Union volunteers. The Supervisory Committee, among other responsibilities, is charged with reviewing the activities of internal audit to ensure that the policies and objectives of the Board of Directors are being performed according to their original specifications. 6. The Audit & Quality Assurance Coordinator reports functionally to the Supervisory Committee and administratively to the Policy Compliance Supervisor, as outlined below. Internal audit generally derives its existence from executive management and from the Supervisory Committee. The department\u2019s effectiveness, even its continued existence, depends on the strength and support of management and the Supervisory Committee. Functional reporting to the Supervisory Committee (i.e., audit reports and audit activities). Administrative reporting to the Policy Compliance Supervisor. (e.g., vacations, hours worked, personal matters, equipment needs). 7. A charter has been established for internal audit. The charter is reviewed and approved by the Supervisory Committee, President/CEO, and the Board of Directors on an annual basis, per eCFR :: 12 CFR Part 715 -- Supervisory Committee Audits and Verifications. 8. Internal Audit Purpose 1. Internal audit is an independent area established within the Credit Union to examine and evaluate the Credit Union\u2019s various functions. Internal audit helps the Board of Directors, Supervisory Committee, management, and membership. It assists them in the effective discharge of their duties and responsibilities by examination and evaluation. The process is designed to verify that: Assets, both physical and proprietary, are safeguarded. Financial and management information regarding operations of the Credit Union is available, accurate, and reliable. The Credit Union is free of conflicts of interest, and the appearance of conflicts, which might prevent the safety and soundness of the Credit Union. Plans and policies established by the Board of Directors and procedures requested by management to comply with applicable laws and regulations are being followed. To fulfill its responsibilities, the internal audit department in conjunction with external audit firms: Develops and implements audit plans, procedures, and audit programs that are responsive and, at the same time, risk- and cost-effective. Recommends improvements to Board of Director approved policies where appropriate. Provides the Supervisory Committee and management with internal audit reports that identify necessary improvements and makes cost-effective recommendations to strengthen operations controls and procedures. Performs special reviews on behalf of the Board of Directors, Supervisory Committee, and management. Resolves audit issues with management that has the most involvement and responsibility. Maintains internal audit standards that ensure the effectiveness and quality of the internal audit effort. 2. The auditor\u2019s review of internal controls is designed to provide reasonable guarantees that management has ensured effective internal controls at reasonable cost. The auditor presents recommendations where controls need to be improved. Follow-up is provided to ensure that effective controls are installed. Assistance in this process is provided, as requested. 9. The scope of internal audit encompasses the examination and evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the Credit Union\u2019s system of internal controls and the quality of performance in carrying out assigned responsibilities. This scope includes: 1. Reviewing the reliability and integrity of financial and operating information and the means used to identify, measure, classify, and report such information. 2. Reviewing the Credit Union\u2019s compliance policies, and the systems established to ensure compliance with policies, plans, procedures, laws, and regulations that could have a significant impact on operations and reports. 3. Reviewing the means of safeguarding assets and, as appropriate, verifying the existence of such assets. 4. Reviewing operations and programs to ascertain whether results are consistent with established objectives and goals and whether the operations and programs are being performed as planned. Audit recommendations are designed to identify problems and suggest solutions where appropriate. The department is responsible for providing accurate follow-up to ensure that appropriate corrective action is taken. It is expected that the audit function will provide a leadership role to assist other departments in ensuring the highest standards of personal and Credit Union performance. 10. Relationship with Management 1. Internal audit reports the results of its activities to management and the Supervisory Committee. Audits must be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the objectives of the Credit Union. Management and its staff are responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining the Credit Union\u2019s accounting systems, internal controls, and policy and procedures. 2. Internal audit advises management as to whether these are adequate, efficient, and effective \u2014 and whether they are being followed by staff. Internal audit is available to management and staff for advice and opinions concerning control procedures. However, to maintain the critically important element of auditor independence, it acts as an adviser by only giving opinions when requested. Any other responsibilities could compromise the independence of future audits. Specifically, auditors cannot control nor have any authority over personnel or departments being audited. 11. Reports 1. Internal audit issues a draft report at the conclusion of every audit. The draft will be discussed with management of the affected department. Discussions with management regarding items noted in the course of the audit will be considered when finalizing the report. Any significant disagreements must be referred by the Audit & Quality Assurance Coordinator to the Supervisory Committee for resolution. Any action taken requires a mutually agreeable solution that is satisfactory to the Audit & Quality Assurance Coordinator and Supervisory Committee. 2. A final report will be written and distributed to the designated recipients of the report, Executive Vice President/COO, President/CEO, and the Supervisory Committee. 3. Whenever a report specifically requires a written response, the audit report will so state. 4. All report responses/management responses are to be directed to the Audit & Quality Assurance Coordinator. The Audit & Quality Assurance Coordinator will forward the report and the response to the Supervisory Committee. The Audit and Quality Assurance Coordinator is responsible for monitoring evidence supporting the closure of any recommendations or correction of exceptions to policy or regulations. The results of the follow-up reviews are to be reported to the Supervisory Committee and the Chief Risk Officer. 12. Ratings in the Audit Report (Varies by external audit firm) 1. Exceptions noted by the auditors include items such as policy violations, materiality matters, and compliance violations (i.e., items that can affect the stability of the credit union), and are separated into the following classifications: High Risk Exceptions. This is an exception that needs immediate attention. The audit has found numerous compliance, policy or procedural errors and immediate corrective measures must be taken. This exception could also create the potential for current or future loss to the credit union. Moderate Risk Exceptions. This is an exception that needs correction, but few errors have been encountered in the procedure and it does not require immediate correction. This exception could have some financial or operational impact, but often minor in nature. Low Risk Exceptions. This is an exception that at the time of the audit does not need immediate correction, but the auditor believes it should be called to the attention of management. This exception has little or no financial impact to the credit union. Audits performed by third party audit firms may be rated based on their rating scale. 2. A rating system will be used in the audit report as a means of evaluating the condition of the area under review at a point in time. The internal auditor has the discretion to apply a rating based upon their judgment regarding the severity/risk level of an exception or their assessment of management's commitment to internal controls. A major breakdown in internal controls causing a possible loss to the credit union could be grounds for an unsatisfactory rating regardless of resulting exceptions.

The privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 required NCUA and the other financial institution regulators to establish appropriate standards relating to the administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for consumer records and information. In early 2001, NCUA issued a rule amending Part 748 to require such safeguards as part of all federally-insured credit unions\u2019 security programs and provided guidance to assist credit unions in meeting these requirements, which were included in the rule as \u201cAppendix A to Part 748 \u2013 Guidelines for Safeguarding Member Information.\u201d SCOPE _All AmeriCU Personnel_ To give AmeriCU employees a reference in the event of unauthorized access to member information. This policy will detail what the necessary actions are. DEFINITIONS N/A RESPONSIBILITY All AmeriCU Employees: Are responsible for taking action to identify and detect possible unauthorized access to member information and for notifying both the Vice President, Legal and Compliance and the Vice President, Information Security, of any possible or identified unauthorized access to member information. Vice President, Legal and Compliance: Is responsible for ensuring that this policy and any related procedure are reviewed at least once annually, and remain compliant with current applicable law and prevailing best practices. The Vice President, Legal and Compliance shall also be responsible for consulting with and/or assisting the Vice President, Information Security, regarding any possible or identified unauthorized access to member information. Vice President, Information Security: Is responsible for investigating and evaluating any possible unauthorized access to member information and taking all action in the below Response Program, as might be appropriate for the particular context. Response Program 1. Assess the situation \u2013 The credit union will assess the nature and scope of the incident and identify the member information systems and types of member information that have been accessed or misused. \u201cMember information systems\u201d include all of the methods used to access, collect, use, transmit, protect, or dispose of member information, including the systems maintained by service providers. 2. Notify Regulatory and Law Enforcement Agencies \u2013 The credit union will notify NCUA or the state regulator when it becomes aware of an incident involving unauthorized access or use of member information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to its members. The credit union will also file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR), as required under the SAR rules. Law enforcement, along with NCUA or the primary state regulator will be notified immediately by telephone if the incident involves a federal criminal violation that requires immediate attention. 1. AmeriCU Contacts: NYS Department of Financial Services, Community & Regional Bank, Contact: Deputy Superintendent, Phone: 212-709-1610, Fax: 212-709-1524 NCUA Eastern Region, Alexandria, VA, Contact: Regional Director, Phone: 703-518-6300, Fax: 703-518-6674 If more than 5,000 New York residents must be notified of a security system information breach, the credit union must notify the consumer reporting agencies of the timing, content and distribution of the notices and approximate number of affected persons. If the credit union must notify New York residents, the law also requires the credit union to notify all the following state agencies: Enterprise Information Security Office (EISO) 1220 Washington Avenue State Office Campus Building 5, 1st Floor Albany, NY 12242 Phone: (518) 242-5200 E-Mail: eiso@its.ny.gov New York State Attorney General\u2019s Office The Capitol Albany, NY 12224-0341 Phone: (518) 776-2000 Department of State, Division of Consumer Protection Consumer Assistance Unit 99 Washington Ave. Albany, NY 12231-0001 Phone: 1-800-697-1220) E-Mail: info@dos.ny.gov 3. Contain and Control the Situation \u2013 The credit union will take measures to prevent further unauthorized access or use of member information, while preserving records and evidence. In connection with computer intrusions, this could include: Shutting down applications or third party connections. Reconfiguring firewalls in cases of unauthorized electronic intrusions. Ensuring that all vulnerabilities in the computer systems have been addressed. Changing computer access codes. Modifying physical access controls. Placing additional controls on service providers. 4. Corrective Measures \u2013 The following are examples of measures that the credit union will take after the credit union understands the scope of the incident and has taken steps to contain and control the situation: Flag accounts \u2013 The credit union will immediately identify and monitor accounts whose information may have been accessed or misused. The credit union will provide staff with instructions regarding the recording and reporting of unusual activity and, if necessary, implement controls to prevent the unauthorized withdrawal or transfer of funds from member accounts. Secure accounts \u2013 When an account number, credit or debit card number, personal identification number (PIN), password, or other unique identifier has been accessed or misused, the account and all other accounts or services that can be accessed with the same numbers and passwords will be secured until the credit union and member agree on a course of action. Consistent with existing guidance, a credit union\u2019s contract with a service provider will require the service provider to disclose any information to the credit union regarding any breach in security resulting from an unauthorized intrusion into the credit union\u2019s member information system maintained by the service provider. The service provider will also be required to take appropriate actions to address incidents of unauthorized access or use of the member\u2019s information that will enable the credit union to quickly implement its response program. 5. Member notice The credit union will provide the member notice when there is an incident of unauthorized access or use of member information. Notices may be restricted to those members whose information was accessed or misused if the credit union is able to determine from its records which members have been affected. If this cannot be determined, the credit union will notify each member in the groups most likely to have been affected by the incident, such as each member whose information is stored in the group of files in question. The credit union will notify affected members when it becomes aware of unauthorized access to \u201csensitive member information,\u201d unless the credit union, after an investigation, reasonably concludes that misuse of the information is unlikely to occur and takes steps to safeguard the interests of affected members, including monitoring the members\u2019 accounts for unusual or suspicious activity. \u201cSensitive member information\u201d means a member\u2019s name, address or telephone number, in conjunction with the member\u2019s social security number, driver\u2019s license number, account number, credit or debit card number or a personal identification number or password that would permit access to the member\u2019s account. Sensitive member information also includes any combination of components of member information that would allow someone to log onto or access the member\u2019s account, such as user name and password or password and account number. Here are examples of when notice will be given, unless the credit union, after an investigation, reasonably concludes that misuse of the information is unlikely to occur and takes steps to safeguard the interests of affected members: An employee of the credit union obtained unauthorized access to sensitive member information. A cyber intruder has broken into a credit union\u2019s unencrypted database that contains sensitive member information. Computer equipment containing sensitive member information has been lost or stolen. The credit union has not properly disposed of member records containing sensitive member information. A third-party service provider has experienced any of the above incidents. Here are examples of when notice would not be expected, in which misuse of the information is unlikely to occur: The credit union is able to retrieve sensitive member information that has been stolen and reasonably concludes, after investigation, that the retrieval occurred before the information was copied, misused, or transferred to another person who could misuse it. The sensitive member information may have been improperly disposed of, but the credit union can establish that the information was not retrieved or used before it was destroyed. A hacker accessed files containing only member names and addresses. A laptop computer containing sensitive member information was lost, but the data is encrypted and may only be accessed with a secure access device. The notice should be timely, clear, conspicuous, and delivered in a manner that ensures that the member is likely to receive it. This may include notice by telephone, mail, or electronic notice for members who conduct transactions electronically. Here is the information that will be included in the notice: Description of the incident in general terms and the information that was the subject of unauthorized access or use. Description of what the credit union has done to protect the members information from further unauthorized access. A telephone number that the member may call for further information and assistance. An explanation of how the member may obtain a credit report free of charge Reminder that the member be vigilant over the next 12 \u2013 24 months and to promptly report incidents of suspected identity theft. The notice should include the following additional items, when appropriate: A recommendation that the member review account statements and immediately report any suspicious activity to the credit union. A description of fraud alerts and an explanation of how the member may place a fraud alert in the member\u2019s consumer reports on notice that the member may be a victim of fraud. The member should periodically obtain credit reports from each CRA and have the information relating to fraudulent activities deleted. A recommendation that the member periodically obtain credit reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency and have information relating to fraudulent transactions deleted. Information about the availability of online guidance from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regarding steps that can be taken to protect against identity theft and to encourage the member to report incidents of identity theft to the FTC. This should include the FTC\u2019s website (www.ftc.gov/idtheft), as well as the telephone number (1-877-IDTHEFT) that the member may also use. Here is additional assistance that the credit union may choose to offer: Toll-free telephone number that members may call for assistance. Helping members in notifying CRAs of the incident and in placing a fraud alert in the member\u2019s consumer reports. Information about subscription services that provide notification to the member whenever there is a request for the member\u2019s credit report. The credit union may offer to provide such a subscription for a limited time, free of charge. Train appropriate CU personnel to respond to member inquiries and requests for assistance. The credit union may also wish to include in the notice a brochure regarding steps that can be taken to protect against identity theft that has been prepared by Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which can be downloaded from the Internet at: www.bulkorder.ftc.gov RESOURCES/REFERENCES eCFR :: Appendix B to Part 748, Title 12 -- Guidance on Response Programs for Unauthorized Access to Member Information and Member Notice eCFR :: Appendix A to Part 748, Title 12 -- Guidelines for Safeguarding Member Information PREVIOUSLY KBID 2349 ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTORS N/A", "policystat_url_direct": "https://americu.policystat.com/policy/15223244/", "policystat_url_latest": "https://americu.policystat.com/policy/15223244/latest/", "policystat_url_guest_access": "https://americu.policystat.com/?lt=cEdmjq-OJYCVZNejpWpI-e&next=%2Fpolicy%2F15223244%2Flatest%2F", "tags": ["Board Approved"]}, {"name": "ACU-11-015 Clean Desk Policy", "id": 15571267, "category_name": "ACU-11 Risk Management", "author_name": "Dupree, Anthony: VP, Information Security", "applicability_group_name": "AmeriCU Credit Union", "text_preview": "POLICY STATEMENT This Policy outlines the actions AmeriCU employees must take to ensure confidential information is appropriately safeguarded while at an AmeriCU location or working remotely.

This program will ensure that key concepts are discussed. This document should be used to gain a basic understanding of how cryptographic information should be safeguarded. The objective of this document is to outline the cryptographic methods associated with the encryption of sensitive data types. Additionally, this document aims to describe how sensitive data is handled at various stages of use and destruction. SCOPE The scope of this document encompasses all systems and processes that work with sensitive data. All AmeriCU personnel DEFINITIONS PCI \\- The payment card industry (PCI) denotes the debit, credit, prepaid, e-purse, ATM, and POS cards and associated businesses. The payment card industry consists of all the organizations which store, process, and transmit cardholder data, most notably for debit cards, and credit cards. PII \\- Information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Cryptography \\- The practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties. Encryption \\- Encryption is the process of encoding a message or information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it and those who are not authorized cannot. RESPONSIBILITY Information Security Officer The Vice President, Information Security is responsible for ensuring adherence to existing policies related to cryptography and encryption. It is also the role of the Vice President, Information Security to advise on key usage and any changes to the requirements. System Owner System Owners are responsible for ensuring that all cryptographic or encryption methods used comply with company policy. System Owners should consult with the Vice President, information Security if they have any question about which methods to utilize. Process Owner Process Owners are responsible for ensuring that all cryptographic or encryption methods used comply with the company policy. Process Owners should consult with the Vice President, Information Security if they have any questions about which methods to utilize. Process Administrator Process Administrators are responsible for implementing cryptographic and encryption systems in the processes they manager. The Process Owner and/or the Vice President, Information Security should be consulted with any questions regarding the implementation of these methods. Sensitive Data Sensitive Data is defined as any data that is not available to the public or types of data that are regulated through law. Examples of sensitive information include PCI, PII, SOX, HIPAA, and GLBA. Other regulated data or sensitive data may also be also considered sensitive such as trade secrets or internal company processes or policies. Data States Transmitted and Received Sensitive data that is sent or received to be sent using secure file transfer methods to provide end to end in motion data encryption. Below are examples of secure file transfer methods that will be employed: 1. SFTP 1. A secure FTP uses SSH to encrypt the data with an SSH key in motion. 2. FTPS 1. FTP SSL uses SSL to encrypt the data in motion typically using certificates. 3. HTTPS 1. HTTP SSL uses SSL to encrypt the data in motion typically using certificates through the web browser. 4. SCP 1. Secure Copy uses SSH to encrypt the data with an SSH key in motion. This is the preferred method to move files between remote internal devices. 5. WebDAVS 1. WebDAVS uses SSL to encrypt data with a certificate in motion, this is most appropriate for collaborative work in the web browser. 6. Secure Email 1. AmeriCU uses Zix to provide a method to encrypt emails sent with sensitive information. 7. SSH 1. Secure Socket Shell is the secure manner in which remote devices should be managed. Stored and Processed Sensitive data may be stored in numerous methods. Sensitive data shall be stored on protected shared storage or a protected database systems. Data stored on shared storage must contain appropriate access control lists as well as be set up to audit access. Sensitive files must be encrypted to the appropriate level when stored or \"at rest.\" Below are examples of ways to encrypt data: 1. Database Encryption 1. Encryption of columns, rows, or fields. 2. Encryption of database flat files. 2. File Storage Encryption 1. Enterprise encryption keys assigned to individual users. 2. Full disk encryption of storage array. Destroyed Data that is marked to be destroyed must be destroyed in a secure manner; even though the data is encrypted, it is imperative to follow the Data/Media Destruction Policy. Cryptographic Security Mechanisms Asymmetric Key Asymmetric Key cryptography, also know as public key cryptography, uses a class of algorithms in which Party 1 has a private key, and Party 2 (and others) have a public key. The public and private keys are generated at the same time, and data encrypted with one key can be decrypted with the other key. That is, a party can encrypt a message using party 1's public key, then only party 1, the owner of the matching private key, can decrypt the message. Asymmetric algorithms are used to achieve authentication, integrity and non- repudiation, and support confidentiality through key management. Symmetric Key Symmetric key cryptography is a class of algorithms where two parties share a secret. These algorithms are primarily used to achieve confidentially, but may also be used for authentication, integrity, and limited non-repudiation. Secure Hash The secure hash function takes a stream of data and reduces it to a fixed size through a one-way mathematical function. The result is called a message digest and can be thought of as a fingerprint of the data. The message digest can be reproduced by any party with the same stream of data, but it is virtually impossible to create a different stream of data that produces the same message digest. Key Components Repository Generated keys must be stored securely in a managed key repository. Access to the repository will be strictly controlled to ensure that only those who need access to keys have access to them. Access to the key repository will further have auditing features enabled and be regularly reviewed. Archive The key archive will be strictly controlled and only accessed for the purposes of recovering keys or backing up new keys. The archive will have auditing features enabled, access will be strictly controlled, and access will be reviewed regularly. Key Storage A method must be available to recover old, expired, or lost keys. An action, authentication, or use of a key must be verifiable even in the event of an expiration or destruction; this is imperative to prove non-repudiation. Encryption Algorithms AES AES or Advanced Encryption Standards (also known as Rijndael) is one of the most widely used methods for encrypting and decrypting sensitive information. This encryption method uses what is known as a block cipher algorithm to ensure that data can be stored securely. AES uses the same symmetric key to encrypt and decrypt information. AES is most appropriate for large amounts of data as it is not as computationally expensive as other asymmetric algorithms. MD5 The MD5 function is a cryptographic algorithm that takes an input of arbitrary length and produces a _message digest_ that is 128 bits long. The digest is sometimes also called the \"hash\" or \"fingerprint\" of the input. MD5 is used in many situations where a potentially long message needs to be processed and/or compared quickly. The most common application is the creation and verification of digital signatures. SHA-2 SHA, or Secure Hash Algorithm, is one of the foundation algorithms used in public key cryptography. SHA-256 is one of the successor hash functions to SHA-1 (collectively referred to as SHA-2), and is one of the strongest hash functions available. SHA-2 is best suited for file verification and digital signatures. Protocols Secure protocols must be used in every case where they are available. If there is no available secure protocol in which to transfer, store, or process data, the application or process must be thoroughly reviewed and be considered for replacement. Using an insecure protocol when a secure protocol is available is prohibited. Secure Protocols _Required Use Cases_ Secure Protocols are required for the following scenarios: 1. Information being sent over public networks 1. Examples include the Internet, radio networks, or Peer tp Peer networks 2. When connected to outside organizations a. Examples include VPN tunnels and email connections Insecure _Acceptable Use Cases_ Insecure protocols are strongly discouraged in every case where there is a secure alternative. Below are some examples of when it _may_ be acceptable to not use secure protocols: 1. Business application does not support secure protocols AND information is not being sent over public networks 1. Applications should be updated or replaced if they do not support secure protocols 2. By exception of the Vice President, Information Security and after validation that sensitive information will not be sent or received RESOURCES/REFERENCES National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST 800-32 - Introduction to Public Key Technology and he Federal PKI Infrastructure https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-32.pdf PREVIOUSLY KBID 5996 ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTORS N/A", "policystat_url_direct": "https://americu.policystat.com/policy/15571497/", "policystat_url_latest": "https://americu.policystat.com/policy/15571497/latest/", "policystat_url_guest_access": "https://americu.policystat.com/?lt=cEdmjq-OJYCVZNejpWpI-e&next=%2Fpolicy%2F15571497%2Flatest%2F", "tags": ["Board Approved"]}, {"name": "ACU-11-012 Information Security Policy", "id": 15576620, "category_name": "ACU-11 Risk Management", "author_name": "Dupree, Anthony: VP, Information Security", "applicability_group_name": "AmeriCU Credit Union", "text_preview": "POLICY STATEMENT The Executive Management and Board of Directors of AmeriCU Credit Union hereafter referred to as the \"Company\", encourage a proactive approach to information security.

Additionally, the Information Security Vice President will work with IT Personnel to establish standard configurations for all systems using widely recognized security industry standards. The Information Security Vice President will work with the Information Systems Owners to define any additional security controls that are commensurate with the sensitivity of the information the system will process, store, or transmit and the possible vulnerabilities of the system. Information System Owner The Information System Owner is the individual in charge of one or more systems, each of which may contain and operate with data owned by various data owners. A system owner is in a position in which they are required to participate, with the Information Security Vice President, the drafting of security policies, procedures, standards, baselines, and guides, as they relate to specific systems. The Information System Owner is responsible disseminating security information about their systems to members of the divisions that use the systems. The responsibilities of the Information System Owner may include the following: 1. Creating an information plan with data owners, system administrators, and end users. 2. Maintaining the agreed upon security plan. 3. Organizing and participating in training sessions about security requirements on the system. 4. Training regarding acceptable use of systems. 5.

Perform System Administrator. 15. Owners may not delegate ownership responsibilities to third party organizations (such as outsourcing firms) or any individual who is not a full-time Company employee. In the absence of both the Owner and the Owner's back-up, the Manager of the department may make \"pressing\" Owner decisions. Information System Administrator The Information System Administrator is the individual(s) responsible for maintaining the information system. The Information System Administrator may also be the Information System Owner as a dual role, however, if this is a dual role, then additional security reviews may be needed to fulfil segregation of duty requirements. The role should only be shared if there are no others that are able to fill the Information System Administrator role. The responsibilities of the Information System Administrator include the following: 1. Implementing the security plan set forth by the Information System Owner. 2. Participate in the planning of the security plan. 3. Participate and implement access and access controls. 4. Set up and delete users. An employee's manager approves a request for access based on existing job role (tellers, loan officer, etc). If a job role doesn't exist for the employee's job function, it is the responsibility of the employee's manager to create a job role based upon the employee's position requirements in their job description and to request approval of the role from various information owners. 5. Work with the Information System Owners and Custodians to prepare and update the business continuity plan for the system. 6. Annually test the business continuity plan, if required, with the assistance of the Information Systems Owner and Custodian. 7. Configure the application user security and logs to comply with this policy. Information System Custodian Information Systems Custodians are in physical or logical possession of information and/or information systems. For those situations where it is unclear who is the Custodian, the Information Security Vice President will designate the Custodian. The responsibilities of the Information System Custodian include the following: 1. Support information systems on behalf of Users and Owners. 2. Manage access to information according to the job profiles defined by Information Systems Owners. 3. Provide technical consulting to Owners to help maximize utilization. 4. Assure procedural safeguards (scheduled backups, access controls, etc.) are adequate to prevent loss of data or inappropriate disclosure of information. 5. Information Custodians must designate a back-up person to act if they are absent or unavailable. Custodians may not delegate ownership responsibilities to third party organizations (such as outsourcing firms) or any individual who is not a full-time Company employee. Information System User Any employee with access to internal information or internal information systems is an Information Systems User. All Users are responsible for safeguarding customer information. Users are required to abide with security requirements defined by Information Systems Owners, implemented by Information Systems Custodians, or established by the Information Security Vice President. Users must participate in information security training and security awareness efforts provided by the Company. The responsibility of Information System Users include: 1. Safe guarding confidential information. 2. Reporting suspected leaking of confidential information. 3. Complying with security guidelines and procedures. Data Roles Data Owner Data owners are identified as the individuals, roles or committees primarily responsible for information assets. These individuals are responsible for: 1. Identifying the organization's information assets under their areas of supervision; and 2. Maintaining an accurate and complete inventory for data classification and handling purposes. Data owners are accountable for ensuring that their information assets receive an initial classification upon creation and a re-classification whenever reasonable. Re-classification of an information asset should be performed by the asset owners whenever the asset is significantly modified. Additionally, data owners are responsible for reporting deficiencies in security controls to management. Data User Any employee, business partners and/or vendors, or member that accesses, manipulates, or transmits AmeriCU information is considered a data user. Internal Audit Internal Audit is responsible for validating that the defined Information System roles and responsibilities are being carried out appropriately and in a timely manner. The Internal Audit department acts as the eyes and ears for senior management and the board of directors to tracks issues until they are fully resolved and is responsible for reporting issues. Internal Audit is furthermore responsible for developing and validating security controls with regard to local, state, national, or Company, regulations or policies. Cyber Security Threat Mitigation Threat Intelligence AmeriCU will establish a means to gather, analyze, and respond to cyber threat intelligence. Cyber threat intelligence will allow AmeriCU receive and review information from reputable organizations and use that information to form protections and mitigations against potential threats to the organization. Members of the Information Security team will additionally work to join information security and cyber security groups where ideas and threat intelligence may be shared. Malware and Virus In order to prevent and control virus or malware outbreaks, all computers, workstations, servers, and devices capable of running the software are required to be installed with anti-virus/anti-malware (AV) software. The AV software must be kept current and updated frequently in order to ensure that the newest virus or malware packages are prevented from running. In addition to host based protection, the network shall also employ software and techniques that prevent the proliferation of malicious activity to include blocking access to malicious websites or locations. Employees and third parties are required to ensure: 1. Anti-virus software installed. 2. That the software is up to date. 3. Ensure they are not downloading or running un-approved software Phishing Employees from time to time will receive phishing emails. The purpose of phishing emails are to trick employees into clicking links that may either download malicious software or ask for private information. Phishing attacks will try to create a sense of urgency for you to ask and often impersonate legitimate people that you know. 1. MTS will ensure an automated phishing detection system is installed, operational, and kept updated. 2. Information security will perform periodic simulated phishing testing against employees. 3. Employees will be required to take phishing training at least yearly. Data Exfiltration Data exfiltration is part of a cyber-attack where the attacker attempts to take data and from the company and move it off of the network. Attackers will often steal data and then attempt to use it as leverage against the company for another end. The following steps can be taken to mitigate data exfiltration: 1. Monitor the network for unusual and large data transfers. 2. Block access to common and known cloud storage providers. 3. Monitor data transfers on non-standard ports. Denial of Service Denial of service attacks are attacks that affect access to resources. Denial of services attacks can be caused with malicious intent or by accidental user access. Denial of service attacks may be prevented by: 1. Employing strong network controls internally and externally. 2. Ensuring systems have enough capacity to handle high bursts of additional requests. 3. Filtering of traffic to resources by only allowing access to systems based on need. Insider Threat Employees may pose a security threat through inadvertent acts or through malicious intent. AmeriCU seeks to mitigate this risk by: 1. Employee cyber security training to include email phishing, computer systems use and responsibility. 2. User rights administration, utilizing the principle of least privilege. 3. Password administration. 4. Physical security of computer and information assets. 5. Identification of common insider threat behaviors. Amateur Attacks or Vandalism Amateur hacking attempts are common with the probability of attack high. Such attacks are usually crimes of opportunity. Hackers scan the Internet to look for well-known security vulnerabilities that have not been mitigated. AmeriCU seeks to mitigate this risk by: 1. Deploying firewalls. 2. Installing antivirus on appropriate systems. 3. Inbound email inspection. 4. User authentication. 5. Internet restrictions. 6. Timely operating system updates. 7. Performing vulnerability assessments against information assets. Criminal Activity Attacks from criminal group hackers are less common but highly effective. The skills of criminal group attackers is medium to high as they are likely to be trained in the use of the latest tools, tactics, and procedures. The attacks are well planned and are based on any weaknesses discovered that will allow a foothold into the network. In addition to mitigations above, AmeriCU further diminishes risk through: 1. Network segmentation. 2. Patch management. 3. Limiting direct network connection through demilitarized zones. 4. Data loss prevention monitoring. 5. Port restrictions. 6. Change management procedures. 7. Firewall and network monitoring. Account Takeovers Account takeover is one of the more prevalent forms of identity theft. It occurs when fraudsters obtain personal or business account information and changes the official mailing address with that individual's financial accounts, or otherwise impersonates an individual authorized on the account. Once accomplished, the fraudsters have established a window of opportunity in which transactions are conducted without the victim's knowledge. ATM Skimming and Point of Sale Schemes ATM skimming is like identity theft for debit cards. Thieves use hidden electronics to steal the personal information stored on a card and record the PIN number to access an account. Skimming takes two separate components to work. The first part is the skimmer itself, a card reader placed over, or within, the ATM's real card slot. When a card is inserted into the ATM, the victim is unwittingly sliding it through the counterfeit reader, which scans and stores all the information on the magnetic strip. The second part requires a device to record PIN keystrokes such as a camera or pressure sensitive keypad cover. AmeriCU takes preventive measures against ATM skimming by contracting with equipment providers for ATM tamper monitoring. 1. Cameras should be used to observe ATM equipment and recorded to a DVR 2. ATM equipment must be equipped with a tamper alarm mechanism Information Handling Digital Storage of Information Users will not store sensitive information (i.e. non-public customer information) on the local hard drive of a computer (including laptop computers) or in mobile devices unless encrypted. User's information should be stored in the network or local My Documents directory on their assigned workstation or laptop. Storage of sensitive information on external media, unless specifically requested and approved, is prohibited. Physical Storage of Information Any physical storage or information such as printed documents, customer provided documents, or any other type of physical information must be stored according to its classification. All employees must follow the Clean Desk Policy, however, special care must be taken when handling sensitive information. Internal Only, Confidential, or Restricted data must be secured when not in use. Securing physical information includes storage in locked containers such as filing cabinets, drawers, or lockers, where a key is required to access the information. Clean Desk The Company's financial centers, as well as its operational offices, may be frequented by members, vendors, cleaning crews, maintenance personnel, and other visitors; it is the responsibility of every employee to ensure that no loss of confidentiality, availability, or integrity could be caused by unauthorized access to documents, computer systems, or other media in his/her work area. Employees are also responsible for making sure that, when leaving their workstation, the appropriate steps have been taken to prevent unauthorized access to any Company information. The Vice President of Information Security will regularly communicate to employees, via email and/or e-Learning courses, a list of suggested measures for maintaining a work area which minimizes the exposure of Company assets. Confidential information should be secured at night or when leaving the area for any extended amount of time, such as leaving for lunch or using a restroom. Disposal of Information Nothing containing sensitive information will be disposed of in the garbage. Paper documents will be placed in designated shred containers or shredded immediately when no longer needed and electronic media (tapes, disks, hard drives, etc.) containing sensitive information will be reformatted and physically destroyed before disposal. Shred bins are located in each branch and should be secured. Accumulated shred will be destroyed on a timely basis, considering any legal, or other valid holds in place. Refer to the Media Security, Storage and Destruction Policy for additional details. Printing, Copying and Fax Transmission Unattended printing, copying, or transmitting is permitted if physical controls (i.e., employee observation) are used to prevent unauthorized persons from entering the area around the printer, copier, or fax machine. Printing, scanning, or faxing is prohibited on personal devices; exceptions will be made only by the Information Security Vice President after consultation with the Risk department and only when physical and logical safeguards are in place to mitigate inherent risks. Printing while at home is prohibited and any attempts to circumvent this policy may result in termination. Access Controls Network/Application Access Rights Administration Approval Access approval for employees will be coordinated between an employee's manager, the Human Resources Department, the Information Security Vice President, and the Information Systems Administrator. Any change in employment that requires access changes will be implemented using the access approval procedures. All non-employee access will be coordinated between project management, the Information Security Vice President, and the Information Systems Administrator using the access approval. Access to Bank Control Update & General Ledger Interface updates on the core processing system can only be approved by the Chief Information Officer or the Chief Risk Officer. Network administrative privileges can only be approved by the CIO and must be periodically reviewed for accuracy. Authentication Each User will be assigned an individual unique user-ID. Anonymous network user-IDs (such as \"guest\") are not allowed unless approved in advance by the Information Security Vice President. Examples of allowed cases are for employees attending training and for bank examiners' use. Generic or auditor type accounts must be managed by an individual who will be responsible for any actions caused on the generic account(s) in question. Users are responsible for all activity that takes place with their user-ID and password. Users must not leave their system unattended for extended periods of time while logged on. Users must notify the Information Security Vice President immediately if they suspect that their password has been compromised. Users are prohibited from sharing any username/password combination, access to sites using single sign-on for personal credentials, or any other authentication information with any other employee or individual; The only exception to this policy is during the initial creation of, or the resetting of, credentials where temporary credentials must be passed along to authorized employees who will be immediately required to change them. Password Protection 1. Always use different passwords for AmeriCU accounts from other non-AmeriCU access (e.g., personal accounts, option trading, benefits, etc.). 2. Always use different passwords for various AmeriCU access needs whenever possible. For example, select one password for systems that use directory services (i.e., LDAP, Active Directory, etc.) for authentication and another for locally authenticated access. 3. Do not share AmeriCU passwords with anyone, including administrative assistants or secretaries. All passwords are to be treated as sensitive and confidential information. 4. Passwords should never be written down or stored on-line without encryption. 5. Do not reveal a password in email, chat, or other electronic communication. 6. Do not speak about a password in front of others. 7. Do not hint at the format of a password (e.g., \"my family name\"). 8. Do not reveal a password on questionnaires or security forms. 9. If someone demands a password, refer them to this document and direct them to the Information Security Department. 10. Always decline the use of the \"Remember Password\" feature of applications. 11. Make use of the official password management system provided by AmeriCU to create and save complex passwords. 12. Passwords shall not be based on easily guessable criteria such as sports teams, favorite car, color, age, birthday, etc. If an account or password compromise is suspected, report the incident to the Information Security Department. Password Requirements The Password Policy will be the source of password requirements for the Company. Use the following guidelines a minimum requirement: 1. Twelve (12) Characters in length. 2. Maximum password age of ninety (90) days. 3. Minimum password age of one (1) day. 4. Password history of twenty-four (24) characters. 5. Account lockout after ten (10) invalid login attempts. 6. Lockout duration of thirty (30) minutes. 7. Adhere to complexity rules: 8. 1 capital letter. 9. 1 lower case letter. 1. 1 number. 2. 1 special character. Other Security Settings Where supported, all applications should have the following security features enabled: 1. Lockout settings after 10 failed password attempts and lockout duration is 30 minutes. 2. Session lockout after period of inactivity such as 15 minutes. 3. Multi-factor authentication for the following: 1. Applications accessed off-network. 2. Cloud-based applications that contain NPI. 3. All accounts performing privileged operations. 4. Where supported, applications should implement single sign-on technology Termination When a User leaves the Company, all access for the separated employee to Company information must immediately cease. The employee's manager should immediately alert the Human Resource department to begin termination procedures. All work done by employees for the Company is Company property, and it must remain with the Company when employee departs. To provide a more orderly transition when an employee departs the Company, access to the employee's My Documents folder and email account may be granted to the supervisor for duration of the Company's retention policy. During this period, any documents needed from the separated employee's folders should be saved to another location. New email received for the separated employee will be forwarded to the internal user designated for the same time period. Messages received or sent prior to departure will be available in cases of demonstrated business need where requested by a senior manager and approved by the Chief Risk Officer. Upon learning of an employees' separation from the Company, the Human Resources Department will notify Information System Administrators who will disable access to systems and applications under their control. Rights will be disabled as of the date of separation in the notice. Where appropriate for security or competitive reasons, access to systems may be terminated earlier than the official separation date at the election of Management. This section applies to all systems to which the separated employee has access including network rights and access to the core processing systems. Notification of a change in employee role will be similarly accomplished so that access rights may be reviewed and modified as appropriate. Deactivation To better manage associated security risk, inactive network and system accounts will be subject to deactivation. After a 30-day period of inactivity, network and system user accounts will be disabled. After a 90-day period of inactivity, unless the employee is on extended leave, the network, or system user account will be deleted unless approved by the Chief Risk Officer or Information Security Vice President. System Administrator Access System Administrators, network administrators, and security administrators will have administrator access to host systems, routers, hubs, and firewalls as required to fulfill the duties of their job. All system administrator passwords will be deleted immediately after any employee who has access to such passwords is separated, or otherwise leaves the employment of the company. Systems Administrators have elevated user privileges for the systems they administer, which may include rights to set up and delete users, add or remove user rights, change parameters, or other advanced rights, and should be limited to only those necessary to administer the system. Administrative rights must be explicitly approved in writing. In all cases, System Administrators should use administrator accounts only for the elevated rights granted (add employees, change user access, modify parameters, etc.) and perform routine functions with an appropriately provisioned user account. Special Access Special access accounts are provided to non-employees requiring temporary system privileges in order to perform their job. These accounts are monitored by the company and require the permission of the Information Security Vice President. These special access network accounts are tracked and reporting will show who currently has a special access account, for what reason, and when it will expire. Special accounts will expire at the end of the period required to complete the work related to their special access. Special access may be extending by Information Security Vice President on a case-by-case basis. Included in special access accounts are temporary system privileges requested by regulators for review purposes. Requests for examiner system access should be submitted by the agency lead examiner to the Chief Risk Officer or Information Security Vice President. System access granted will be temporary and will be set to expire at the end of end of the stated examination period. Access may be extended as needed upon agency request to the Chief Risk Officer or Information Security Vice President or a designee. Privacy Clients Our clients have entrusted their information to the company for business purposes. Company employees must be diligent to safeguard the privacy and security of this information. Client account data is confidential and access will be limited based on business need for such access. Please see the Company's Privacy Policy for details. Employees All information generated, created, compiled, or otherwise pieced together during an employees' work time and/or on the Company's equipment, for the benefit of the Company and/or its members, is the property of the Company. Employees will have no expectation of privacy when using information systems at the Company. To manage systems and enforce security, the Company may log, review, and otherwise utilize any information stored on or passing through its systems, including electronic mail or remotely viewing and/or accessing Company owned equipment. AmeriCU will take precautions not to capture, intercept, or otherwise compromise the confidentiality of the employees' private information such as personal banking information or health information if it is accessed using AmeriCU equipment. Partners Employees from time to time may engage partners or third-party vendors in the course of their duties. Employees have a special requirement not to share sensitive, private, or otherwise confidential information unless there is a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) that has been executed by both parties. Employees must make sure that if sensitive information must be shared in the course of business arrangements or general engagements it must be limited only to what is required to complete any work or dealings. Information System Usage Personal Use All User activity is subject to logging and subsequent analysis. Users must not perform any activity on Company information systems that is contrary to Company's stated mission or business standards of conduct, or is considered unprofessional conduct, is unethical, or is illegal. It is recognized that employees may, for example, occasionally make a personal phone call or receive a non-business email from a friend or relative. Access to personal email services is blocked and prohibited for use while using AmeriCU equipment. Incidental personal use of Company information systems is permissible so long as the usage does not interfere with job performance, does not deny or hinder other User's access to system resources, and does not incur significant costs. Testing Prohibition Employees must not test or attempt to compromise any information security mechanism unless specifically authorized to do so by the Information Security Vice President. Employees are prohibited from possessing software or other tools (password cracking software, port scanners, etc.) that are designed to compromise or otherwise assess information security without the approval of the information security department. The following exceptions are pre- authorized: 1. The information security department for the purpose of penetration testing. 2. External auditors for the purpose of penetration testing with a valid work order. 3. Network management tools used by the IT department for monitoring or troubleshooting purposes. Company E-mail Address The Company furnishes e-mail access to most employees as a business tool. As such, Company e-mail should be used for business purposes only. Users may assume no expectation of personal privacy in sending or receiving messages using Company e-mail addresses. It is expected that employees use their personal e-mail accounts to send and receive non-business-related messages. Users must not post their AmeriCU Bank e-mail address on any non-business website regardless of whether that site is accessed from company equipment or during non-business hours. This includes any site where an email address is required for registration, verification, or identification, unless it is for business purposes for applications and services for which the Company expressly subscribed or purchased. Activities explicitly prohibited using an AmeriCU email address: 1. Using an AmeriCU email address for personal registrations, verifications, or other identification is prohibited. 2. Spoofing a personal email address to appear as an AmeriCU address. 3. Sending spam or un-solicited emails. The above prohibited activity is not exhaustive and from time to time may be updated or modified. If you are unsure of whether you should use your AmeriCU email address for a specific activity, contact the information security department. Sending Information The company has a secure email system that allows emails containing non-public customer information and non-public information to be sent securely when appropriate to do so under this policy. 1. Users must not include sensitive information including non-public customer confidential information and non-public financial information in electronic mail messages sent through the Internet unless these messages are secured. 2. Users must not forward emails externally that contain non-public customer confidential information and non-public financial information unless the message is secured. 3. Configuring a user's email to automatically forward to an external address is prohibited. 4. Non-public and sensitive information shall not be sent outside of the network, encrypted or otherwise, unless there is a valid business reason to do so. Harassing or Offensive Messages Sexual, ethnic, racial, harassment, or otherwise discriminatory messages are strictly prohibited. Users are encouraged to contact the originator directly (not via e-mail reply) to cease sending offensive electronic mail messages or other communications. If the originator does not promptly stop sending offensive messages, employees are charged with reporting the communications to their manager and the Human Resources Department. E-Mail Content Filtering Outbound e-mail is scanned by an automated system for unprofessional, offensive, sensitive information, or other content that could reflect negatively upon the reputation of AmeriCU or the employee sending the email. E-mails with such content, whether composed by the user or forwarded from an external source, are prohibited. Messages that contain sensitive information in particular will be checked by the data loss prevention (DLP) application. Message will be automatically blocked from sending. The sender must check their message for the offending content and either remove it before attempting to resend the message or encrypt the email if it is required to be sent. If the system flags content that does not appear to be sensitive, contact the information security department to assist in reviewing the content. Inbound email is also scanned by a security vendor to identify and attempt to block unsolicited advertisements (spam), phishing attempts, email with other malicious intent (virus/malware content), prohibited attachments, and other unprofessional content as deemed necessary to protect the resources of AmeriCU. Sharing and Forwarding Electronic mail accounts, like user-IDs, are for specific individuals and must not be shared. 1.

Therefore, management adopts the following Member Information Protection Policy. There are many critical elements of this policy, including assessing risk, assigning accountability, active management, ongoing testing and monitoring, continuing training and education, development of internal controls, and planning for future developments. Per Part 748 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations, the Board of Directors or an appropriate committee of the Board of each credit union should approve the credit union's written Member Information Protection Policy. SCOPE All AmeriCU Employees DEFINITIONS Management will take steps necessary to identify internal and external threats that could result in unauthorized disclosure, misuse, alteration, or destruction of member information or member records. Risks may include, but are not limited to: 1. Compromise of confidentiality as a result of unauthorized member account access 2. Compromise of confidentiality as a result of unauthorized system access 3. Interception of data during transmission 4. Loss of data integrity 5. Physical loss of data, whether malicious, accidental or during an unavoidable event such as a disaster 6. Poor audit trails 7. Errors introduced into the system, whether accidentally or maliciously 8. Corruption of data or systems 9. Lack of transaction completeness and documentation 10. Unauthorized access of information by employees 11. Unauthorized transfer of information through third parties Management recognizes that this may not be a complete list of the risks associated with the protection of member information. Since technology constantly develops and the business changes over time, new risks are regularly created. RESPONSIBILITY Management is responsible for assessing risks for unauthorized transfer of member information and ensuring that procedures are in place to minimize risk to the credit union. Management will control risk to the credit union by using a process of identifying, measuring and monitoring risks for which the credit union must be prepared. Department Heads must develop a risk assessment in their areas and implement a written program for protecting member information. The assessments and programs will be reviewed and updated not less than annually. Risk Management will assist management in the coordination of all risk areas that have access to member information to assess the internal control structure put in place by management and to verify that all credit union departments adhere to the general requirements of this policy. Management will include at least the following elements in its Member Information Protection Plan. Risk Assessment Department Heads will prepare a written risk assessment for his or her area that identifies the internal and external threats to unauthorized disclosure of member information. This assessment will be reviewed and updated annually. Internal Routines and Controls Management together with Risk Management will develop a range of comprehensive system reviews and tests to validate the controls incorporated into each credit union area to protect member information. Management is instructed to train all users on the need to adhere to control standards. Management Supervision and Internal Controls Department Heads will be actively involved in decision-making processes to contain risks effectively. Management will review, approve and monitor new products and delivery channels that may have a significant impact on the credit union's protection of member information. The Information Security Vice President will submit quarterly reports to the Board or an appropriate committee of the board on the overall status of the member information protection program and summarize any information security-related incidents that occurred within the three-month period being reported on. Service Providers Due to the specialized expertise needed to design, implement and service new technologies, vendors may be needed to provide resources that the credit union is unable to provide on its own. However, management remains responsible for the performance and actions of these vendors, while they are performing work for the credit union. Service Provider Agreements Management will ensure that a clause is included in all contracts with service providers to implement appropriate measures to safeguard member information and to refrain from sharing any member information with any other party. Due Diligence of Service Providers Management is directed to determine the adequacy of the service provider's system of protecting information based on the service to be performed by the provider. Depending on the risk rating assigned to the service provider, management may be required to review such resources as a SOC-2 Type II, ISO270001 Certification, audit document, PCI compliance documentation, disaster recovery plan and more. These activities fall under AmeriCU's Vendor Management Program and are managed under the Risk Management area. Expertise and Training It is critical to the success of a member information protection program that key employees and vendors have the expertise and skills to perform necessary functions and that they are properly trained. Management will authorize sufficient resources to hire and train employees and will ensure that adequate backup exists if key people leave. Training may include technical course work, attendance at industry conferences, and participation in industry working groups, as well as time allotments for appropriate staff to keep abreast of important technological and market developments. Credit union employees will be trained, as necessary, regarding the credit union's policies and procedures for protecting the privacy of our members' personally identifiable information. Management is also directed to keep documentation of this training for review by auditors and examiners. Testing Testing is necessary to validate that equipment and systems function properly and produce the desired results. In addition, each department should perform ongoing assessments to ensure that credit union staff follows written procedures for member information security. Further, all internal or external audits should include appropriate tests that ensure that the privacy of our members' nonpublic personally identifiable information is protected. Management will report the results of such tests annually or more often as determined by each department's risk assessment and written program. Contingency Planning and Business Continuity The risk of equipment failure and human error is possible in all systems. System failures and unauthorized intrusions may result from design defects, insufficient system capacity, natural disasters, inadequate staff training, or uncontrolled reliance on vendors. This subject is discussed in the credit union's Business Contingency Plan.

The Log management policy is required to ensure all pertinent audit data is available to be reviewed and alerted on. SCOPE All AmeriCU employees and affiliates DEFINITIONS N/A RESPONSIBILITY Roles Vice President of Information Security The Vice President of Information Security is responsible for overseeing this policy and working with stakeholders to ensure that systems are appropriately configured to gather and forward the appropriate audit information into the central collection system. The Information Security Vice President will also be responsible for updating this policy and related procedures. Information System Owner The Information System Owner is responsible for ensuring that systems are capable of meeting the requirements of this policy. The Information System Owner is also responsible for ensuring that this policy is fully implemented on the systems they own. The Information System owner may delegate some responsibilities to the Information System Administrator. Information System Administrator The Information System Administrator is responsible for gaining direction from the Information System Owner on the requirements for logging. The Information System Administrator is responsible for implementing and validating that the appropriate audit settings are configured and working as intended. The Information System Administrator will report progress or any chances to the audit configuration to the Information System Owner. Log Management Configure Log Source Systems connecting to the AmeriCU network must meet a certain set of criteria related to auditing to ensure that there is adequate information collected. 1. The action performed or attempted 2. Who or what performed the action, including where or on what system the activity was performed from (subject) 3. What the action was performed on (object) 4. When the action was performed 5. What facility, program or tool(s) the action was performed with 6. The status (such as success vs. failure), outcome, or result of the action Log Generation 1. Create, read, update, or delete confidential information, including confidential authentication information such as passwords; 2. Create, update, or delete information not covered in 1; 3. Initiate a network connection; 4. Accept a network connection; 5. User authentication and authorization for activities covered in 1 or 2 such as user login and logout; 6. Grant, modify, or revoke access rights, including adding a new user or group, changing user privilege levels, changing file permissions, changing database object permissions, changing firewall rules, and user password changes; 7. System, network, or services configuration changes, including installation of software patches and updates, or other installed software changes; 8. Application process startup, shutdown, or restart; 9. Application process abort, failure, or abnormal end, especially due to resource exhaustion or reaching a resource limit or threshold (such as for CPU, memory, network connections, network bandwidth, disk space, or other resources), the failure of network services such as DHCP or DNS, or hardware fault; and 10. Detection of suspicious/malicious activity such as from an Intrusion Detection or Prevention System (IDS/IPS), anti-virus system, or any other security or infrastructure tools. Log Storage AmeriCU will ensure that all logs and audit data is stored in a centralized manner and on a centralized system. The log storage system will have features that enable logs to be reviewed and send alerts when suspicious activity is detected. Stored logs should contain only audit information that is useful to the security of technology team; some logs may be sent to give context to other events but will not be required for long term retention. If the log or audit information is not useful it should be disposed of to ensure there is enough storage for more useful information. The central syslog server will be monitored for system disk capacity, availability, and running of the syslog process. Security logs will be actively available for 13 months, at which point they will be downloaded and archived for long term storage; additionally, logs related to compliance requirements will be stored for a minimum of 3 years and up to 7 years. Log Security Infrastructure and Information System Administrators must ensure that the integrity and availability of log data is protected at all times. In addition to integrity and availability, it is recommended to protect the confidentiality of the log and audit data due to the possibility of ongoing security investigations. Below are general guidelines for protecting log and audit data on both log sources and the centralized solution: 1. Limit access to log files. Users should not have access to most log files and should only have access if it is required for their job. Users should not have the ability to modify log data. 2. Avoid recording sensitive data when able. If sensitive information is not required in audit data then it should not be recorded. Sensitive data may include data such as passwords, credit card information, PII, PHI, but could include other data. 3. Protect archived log files. Ensure that there are protections for backup log and audit data that can be recovered later for review. Protection of log and audit information includes both physical and logical controls that ensure only appropriate employees can access the data. 4. Ensure that the systems generating logs are secure and not compromised. 5. Use secure methods when moving log files. Log Analysis AmeriCU will ensure that an analysis of logs occurs either manually or automatically. Analysis should include correlation of logs from multiple sources to ascertain whether a larger event is occurring. Logs and audit data should be organized or categorized in a way that makes them able to be easily understood and followed to find potential issues. Example organization attributes: 1. Source or Destination IP address 2. Known bad host addresses 3. Event category 4. Source or Destination Network 5. User identity 6. Country Code 7. Event Duration Logs and audit information must have some amount of prioritization for review based on the source of the log information. Below are some attributes that could warrant a higher priority: 1. Critical information system 2. Sensitive network segment 3. Privileged users Event Response Once an event is identified through the use of logs and audit information an appropriate response must be taken. There are several ways to classify events and the classification will dictate the response. The type of response depends on the event and will be covered in in the Incident Response Policy. Monitoring Logs sent to the central monitoring system will be periodically reviewed. The central system should generate alerts based on the severity of the event. In addition to the alerts, logs should periodically be reviewed by the information security team. Logs should be reviewed at a minimum daily and when alerts are generated. The logging system will include a way to find and organize logs from a multitude of system and allow alerting when certain criteria is met. The logging system will have a method that looks at all the logs its received and compare them against a rule set to determine the severity of the alert and assign a confidence level. Retention Requirements Audit information must be saved on a centralized system that allows easy viewing, cataloging, and reviewing of the data. The following are elements that must be captured and stored. 1. Type of action \u2013 examples include authorize, create, read, update, delete, and accept network connection. 2. Subsystem performing the action - examples include process or transaction name, process or transaction identifier. 3. Identifiers (as many as available) for the subject requesting the action - examples include user name, computer name, IP address, and MAC address. Note that such identifiers should be standardized in order to facilitate log correlation. 4. Identifiers (as many as available) for the object the action was performed on - examples include file names accessed, unique identifiers of records accessed in a database, query parameters used to determine records accessed in a database, computer name, IP address, and MAC address. Note that such identifiers should be standardized in order to facilitate log correlation. 5. Before and after values when action involves updating a data element, if feasible. 6. Date and time the action was performed, including relevant time-zone information if not in Coordinated Universal Time. 7. Whether the action was allowed or denied by access-control mechanisms. 8. Description and/or reason-codes of why the action was denied by the access-control mechanism, if applicable Events A: Alerts C: Collect logs P: Periodic Review of Logs Event | HIPAA | GLBA | PCI | Best Practice | AmeriCU ---|---|---|---|---|--- Access | User Failed Login | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P Privilege Successful Login | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P Privilege Failed Login | C, P, A | C, P, A | C, P, A | C, P, A | C, P, A Accounts | Privilege Account Created/Modified/Deleted | C, P | C, P, A | C, P | C, P | C, P, A Configuration Changes | C, P | C, P, A | C, P | C, P | C, P, A Security Policy Change | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P, A Permission Changes | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P Firewall and Network | Source of Request | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P Destination of Request | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P Action of Request (Accept, Reject, Drop) | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P Time and Date of Event | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P Network Intrusion Attempt | C, P, A | C, P, A | C, P, A | C, P, A | C, P, A Username | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P Active Directory | Log in/Log out | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P Time and Date of Event | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P Login Source | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P Login Type (Console, RDP, etc) | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P Username | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P DNS Name | C | C | C | C | C Servers and Workstations | Log in/Log out | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P Time and Date of Event | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P, A | C, P System Events Cleared | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P Login Source | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P Application | Privilege Account Created/Modified/Deleted | C, P | C, P | C, P, A | C, P, A | C, P, A Configuration Changes | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P Security Policy Change | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P, A Permission Changes | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P Log in/Log out | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P Time and Date of Event | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P Database | Object Accessed | C, P | C, P, A | C, P | C, P | C, P, A Username | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P Privilege Account Created/Modified/Deleted | C, P | C, P | C, P, A | C, P | C, P Configuration Changes | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P Security Policy Change | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P, A Permission Changes | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P | C, P RESOURCES/REFERENCES N/A PREVIOUSLY KBID 5519 ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTORS N/A", "policystat_url_direct": "https://americu.policystat.com/policy/15577002/", "policystat_url_latest": "https://americu.policystat.com/policy/15577002/latest/", "policystat_url_guest_access": "https://americu.policystat.com/?lt=cEdmjq-OJYCVZNejpWpI-e&next=%2Fpolicy%2F15577002%2Flatest%2F", "tags": ["Board Approved"]}, {"name": "ACU-11-032 Identity and Access Management Policy", "id": 15610047, "category_name": "ACU-11 Risk Management", "author_name": "Dupree, Anthony: VP, Information Security", "applicability_group_name": "AmeriCU Credit Union", "text_preview": "POLICY STATEMENT The purpose of this policy is to define required access control measures to all credit union systems and applications to protect the privacy, security, and confidentiality of information technology resources. The identity and access management process involves systems owner performing periodic reviews of the assigned privileges for systems they own and manage. SCOPE This policy is applicable to individual account holders as well as system owners and managers. It defines account holders\u2019 responsibilities to protect their accounts and properly use their authorizations. This policy applies to those responsible for the management of user accounts or access to shared information or network devices. Such information can be held within a database, application, or shared file space. This policy covers departmental accounts as well as those managed centrally. DEFINITIONS User Accounts : These are uniquely associated with a specific person. These accounts may either exist in a central repository to which systems may federate in order consume the identity and authentication information or they may be created locally on a system or device where federation is not practical or possible. The use of the centrally created account with federated authentication is always the preferred method. Shared Accounts : Shared accounts are created to support multiple users sharing the same identity. For example, these may be created when there is a need to share a set of resources or because a poor product implementation requires it. The use of shared accounts is highly discouraged as it lacks accountability. Service Accounts : A service account is used when it is necessary for systems or applications to authenticate to other systems or applications without any association to a person. Their use must be periodically reviewed by the system owner. Further, the password requirements for service accounts must be no less stringent than user accounts as per password policy. Service account creation and use must be documented; documentation includes what system it is used within, the purpose for which it is needed, the project owner the service account is associated with, and who is responsible for the maintenance of the account. Service accounts may not be used by people to authenticate aside from initial testing. Service accounts with elevated privileges must be closely monitored for abuse. Information System Owner/System Owner : A system owner is an individual who manages the system or application. The system owner is responsible for participating in the security process as well as periodically reviewing the access to their systems. See ACU-11-012 for additional roles and responsibilities. Privileged Accounts : Certain accounts may have extra privileges related to the management of a device or application. This is often thought of as an account type, but it is more accurately described as an account with privileged authorizations. Administrative privilege can be added to any of the three account types. Having at least one account with privileges is generally unavoidable but the use of privilege should be limited and the direct use of shared accounts with privileges is discouraged as it lacks accountability. All privileged accounts (root, super user, and administrator passwords for servers, databases, infrastructure devices and other systems) must adhere to the requirements listed as password Standards. Access : The ability to use, modify, or manipulate an information resource or to gain entry or to a physical or logical location. Access Control : The process of granting or denying specific requests for obtaining and using information or applications. The purpose of an access control is to prevent unauthorized access to IT systems. Availability : Protection of information systems and data ensuring that timely and reliable access to, and use of, information and systems to authorized users is possible. Confidentiality : Protection of sensitive information from unauthorized disclosure to individual, entities, or processes, that do not have need of the information. Authentication : The authentication process determines whether someone, or something is, in fact, who or what it declares to be. Authentication validates the identity of the person. Authentication methods involve presenting both a public identifier (such as a username or identification number) and private authentication information, such as a Personal Identification Number (PIN) or password. Authorization : Authorization is the process used to grant privileges to authenticated users. Authorization grants the user, through technology or process, the right to use the information assets and determines what type of access is allowed (read-only, create, delete, and/or modify). The system or application should determine if the user has permission to perform the requested operation. Users are not authorized to access sensitive data unless the System Owner has given written permission through established business processes. Roles : A collection of individual privileges that make up the required access for an individual to perform their job responsibilities on a specific information system or data. Roles will follow the least privilege principle. Least Privilege : An authorization should only provide the privileges required for the function to be performed and no more. Following this principle helps ensure proper workflows are followed and access to functions that may expose data is contained as much as possible. Separation of Duties : When an authorization is granted to an account it must be approved by multiple individuals. Multiple approvers ensures that the Principle of Least Privilege is followed from both a technical and process perspective, decreases opportunity for conflict of interest or fraud, and reduces the risk of error. As applied to authorization, separation of duties requires that the administrative and technical approver. Principles of Authorization : Administrative and technical approvals are always required. These approvers must: 1. Ensure the principles of Least Privilege and Separation of Duties are applied. 2. When approving privileges to a shared account consider everyone who has access to that account and whether such privilege is appropriate for everyone. RESPONSIBILITY Account and Authorization Audits The Information Security team will make routine requests to audit the accounts and authorizations of any AmeriCU Credit Union information system along with the associated audit trail or audit logs. These audits will ensure that accounts and authorizations are consistent with this document, including that: 1. There is a request for every account with elevated privilege, shared account, or service/process account. 2. The request was approved both by an administrative and technical manager. 3. The request is compliant with applicable regulation, policy, and/or best practice. 4. The granted privileges were indeed required for the approved administrative use. 5. Requests for temporary privileges are expired on the agreed expiration date. 6. Every account is held by a person still at the organization; and the account holder\u2019s job function still requires the granted privilege. Information System Owner/System Owner System owners are responsible for establishing data access procedures that must include, at a minimum, the following: 1. Access request forms must be used to request, change, or delete existing access privileges to organization systems that contain sensitive information. 2. To maintain the requirements of minimum necessary and least privilege, when a user transfers, all accounts should first be disabled, privileges removed, then accounts re-enabled and privileges added that are required in the user\u2019s new role. 3. Request for new accounts and changes to existing accounts, portions of the form must be completed and authorized by the: Person who is requesting access to the system User\u2019s supervisor and/or department head (or designated representative) System Owner 4. Request for account deletions, Report separations in a timely manner when employees are reassigned, promoted, or separated. For Termination with cause, deactivation must occur immediately. 5. A periodic review of user privileges must be performed to ensure access is appropriate with user\u2019s current responsibilities, as well as modification, removal, or inactivation of accounts when access is no longer required. 6. System owners must maintain a list of user roles that are required for employees to perform their assigned duties and functions. The roles will be used when performing periodic system user access reviews. It is the system owner\u2019s responsibility to ensure that all users with access to sensitive data attend proper training as well as read and acknowledge the organization\u2019s confidentiality agreement. It is also the system owner\u2019s responsibility to follow the organization\u2019s employment process as defined by Human Resources to ensure compliance with various laws and regulations. Shared and Service Accounts: Credentials for accounts that are shared or used by systems or applications must be managed carefully. Follow the following rules when managing these credentials: 1. Ensure that only people with a need to know a password have access to it. 2. Where reasonable, use multifactor authentication for these accounts, especially on accounts that have privilege such as application or system administrator accounts. 3. Avoid saving passwords in scripts and configuration files that can be read by others. 4. Where possible, apply secondary controls on how these accounts may be used such as by controlling where the accounts will be used from (on site only, e.g.) or when (working hours only). 5. Documentation is required that must be available on request that describes what the account does, who has access to the shared account, and who is responsible for managing the account, including the actual account management. 6. System to system, system to application, and application to application service accounts shall use the most secure authentication method available; SAML, OAuth, certificate based, or token based. Exceptions : Information Security team is authorized to grant exceptions to the requirements set forth in this document. Any exception granted will require a thorough review of the situation and the implementation of appropriate compensating controls. In addition, Information Security team may publish directives/procedures aimed at clarifying the intent of the standard to aid in the interpretation of this policy. Compliance : System owners must have documented procedures for access control and must be able to produce the documented procedures when required for auditing purposes or review. Evidence of account approval, termination, and disabling must be available when required. Failure to comply with this policy may result in harm to employees, members, or the organization. The unauthorized or unacceptable use of organization data, including the failure to comply with these standards, constitutes a violation of organization policy and may subject the user to revocation of the privilege to use organization data or Information Technology or disciplinary action.

Management is aware of the many regulations that dictate recommended Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Strategies. One of these was the revision to the FFIEC guidelines on Business Continuity Planning in March 2008, which was adopted by the NCUA. This plan has been written to comply with the guidelines recommended in that document. This comprehensive Business Continuity Plan (BCP) includes details of the recovery process, documentation, and resource requirements for both Information Technology and the critical business units. The overall plan document provides generalized procedures for disaster situations as well as team structures, plan assumptions, and operational information. The Business Continuity Plan (BCP) includes teams responsible for specific tasks based on critical business and technical functionality. During a disaster, some team members may not be available at certain times or others may not be aware of all necessary procedures to accomplish their mission. The team must remain flexible and may need to develop creative solutions in order to implement strategies for recovery of business functions. In doing so the team must recognize that they are accountable for the continuance of critical functions and that any creative solutions or the exercise of flexibility does not overlook these functions. Delegation of tasks may be necessary during an actual recovery event. SCOPE All AmeriCU Employees DEFINITIONS N/A RESPONSIBILITY Background Plan Coordination and Oversight The Executive Management Team of the credit union, as well as the Board of Directors and Supervisory Committee, have a responsibility for protecting all assets of the organization. These assets include employees, physical property, data, relationships, reputations, and records relating to the credit union and its overall business operations. Responsibilities of the Executive Management Team, Board of Directors, and Supervisory Committee include: 1. Identifying and protecting all assets. 2. Assigning appropriate personnel to oversee the protection of each asset within their area of expertise and control. 3. Ensuring that all employees understand their obligation to protect the credit union's assets. 4. Implementing procedures which are consistent with generally accepted practice and adhere to the credit union\u2019s policy and any regulatory guidelines 5. Assigning responsibilities for establishing, maintaining, coordinating, and testing a Business Continuity Plan. Business Continuity Coordinator Mark Livesey, Chief Risk Officer, will act as the Business Continuity Coordinator for the credit union. The role of the Business Continuity Coordinator is to assign responsibility for establishing, maintaining, and testing the Business Continuity Plan. The Business Continuity Coordinator will keep Executive Management updated on an as needed basis. Board and Executive Management Oversight The Business Continuity Plan will be reviewed and approved on an annual basis by Executive Management and the Board of Directors. Scope and Objectives The principal purpose of the Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is to provide the credit union with a method and approach to effectively direct the recovery and continuation of business operations after a disaster, defined as an unforeseen significant disruption of service, in an orderly and timely manner. During the disaster period, this BCP will provide an orderly process to restore daily operations for those areas considered critical and required to continue to keep the credit union functioning along with relocation of personnel. _Objectives of this plan are as follows:_ 1. To protect the credit union\u2019s assets. 2. To detail the correct course of action to pursue following a business interruption. 3. To affect a prioritized, quick and complete recovery of services. 4. To identify resources (both internal and external) required to ensure an effective and timely recovery. 5. To identify and provide adequate resources required to continue critical business functions. 6. To minimize confusion, errors, and expense to the credit union. 7. To reduce risks of loss of services. 8. To ensure the continued viability of this plan. Assumptions and Considerations 1. None or not all of the branches have been affected by the same incident. 2. It will be assumed that the credit union will not be subject to two simultaneous disasters; however, in planning for one type of disaster, it is realized that one disaster can cause another. 3. Key personnel, or their designated backup are available following a disaster. 4. Critical employees will be relocated to a contingency site or work remotely as the situation allows. 5. Connections to the core system will be made from the contingency sites. 6. All security measures at the contingency sites are in accordance with the credit union\u2019s policies. 7. Connectivity to all utilities are operational at the contingency site. 8. Connectivity will be made to all branches from the contingency site. 9. The network, including Active Directory, will be recovered following a disaster affecting the data center. 10. Access to Microsoft Office, the internet, and Email will be granted following a recovery effort. These applications may not be individually noted in the BIA. It is assumed that all departments are dependent on MTS following a business interruption. 11. All critical suppliers and vendors are available to support the credit union. AmeriCU Credit Union has reviewed SLAs and Business Continuity Plans for all third party resources. Critical resources required for business operations are available from identified suppliers or off-site storage. 12. Each Business Unit is responsible for ensuring that the necessary supplies are available following a business interruption that requires relocation. 13. The BCP Plan is not intended to provide a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d environment but will provide for continuity of daily operations of critical applications and business functions in a scaled back environment. 14. Recovery expectations have been communicated and approved by managers and Executive Management and reported to the Board of Directors and Supervisory Committee. 15. The facility will be repaired or reconstructed as quickly as possible in order to initiate the return from the contingency site. If reconstruction is not deemed possible in a timely manner, a new facility will be obtained. 16. It is assumed that the credit union will have the ability to recover from incidents causing partial losses if all procedures and processes for responding to a total outage have been considered. 17. Proper cooperation and resources will be provided based upon the importance of the business function to support a timely recovery. 18. Management personnel are to maintain their normal lines of authority reporting structure at all times and act as a Team Member or Leader when appropriate. 19. All personnel will maintain their normal lines of reporting and authority separate from their roles specific to the disaster. 20. In the event of a disaster, all personnel participating as Team Members must keep current with their responsibilities as defined in the plan. 21. Team Members must keep abreast of and communicate any plan changes or improvements. 22. Team Members have the responsibility to share expertise as needed throughout the disaster. 23. Team Members have the ability to designate responsibilities to other members of their department who have the expertise to execute the task(s). However, team members will be held accountable for the responsibilities being completed. 24. Expenses during a disaster will be recorded in a separate disaster ledger. 25. Daily operational, off-line, and recovery procedures will not be documented in this Plan. Each department unit is responsible to create and maintain any procedures critical to daily operations. These procedures should be stored off-site in a secure location and on the network if it is being backed up. 26. Maintenance of the plan must be performed on a continuing basis, as changes to the business requirements and technology must be reflected. 27. Components of the plan must be tested periodically \u2014 at least annually is recommended. 28. Test Objectives should vary from test to test to consider various areas of the credit union. 29. A copy of this plan will be provided to all of the Executive Management Team. The plan will be secured in an online BCP tool that is readily available to those who have been granted access. Incidents and Scenarios AmeriCU Credit Union has undergone a thorough investigation of a variety of scenarios or \u201cincident\u201d types. A high-level summary of the response for various incident types can be found in subsequent sections of this plan. Recognizing that it is impossible to plan for every type of situation that could potentially occur, the credit union has instead documented the recovery process for a total outage from any type of an incident that can compromise the credit union\u2019s ability to conduct business as usual. Details of the recovery strategy implemented for the scenarios can be found in subsequent sections of this plan. It has been decided that the worst case scenario for AmeriCU Credit Union is an incident that has impacted the credit union\u2019s ability to function but has NOT affected the credit union\u2019s members, who are expecting service as usual. If an outage occurs at any of the individual branches, employees and members will be relocated to the next nearest branch(es). Signs will be posted at the affected branch with details and the main phone number of the credit union. An incident only affecting one branch will not be considered a disaster and will not require the recovery of systems or activation of the BCP. It is assumed that all third-party processing systems are available during an incident affecting AmeriCU Credit Union. It is important to note that there may be outages that do not constitute a full-blown disaster requiring activation of the credit union-wide Business Continuity Plan. Certain outages may be contained and repaired by the appropriate personnel. It is assumed that the credit union will have the ability to recover from incidents causing partial losses if all procedures and processes for responding to a total outage have been considered. Incidents will be categorized as three different types of severity: Minor Incidents A minor event is classified as an event causing a business interruption of less than one business day. These types of incidents are usually containable following the response of the Facilities department or the responsible technology personnel. These incidents may affect only a part of a building, one branch, or one process. They are incidents that are considered to be more of a nuisance than anything else. Major Incidents A major event is classified as an event causing an outage of more than one business day but less than two days. This type of incident is more of a nuisance than a minor incident but is also containable and has a projected resolution timeframe. Disaster Incidents A disastrous event is classified as an event causing an outage of more than two business days. This type of incident is widespread and usually impacts an entire facility, several business units, and many processes. This type of incident will require activation of the credit union\u2019s contingency sites. It is important to remember that a determination of the severity of an outage will be determined on a case-by-case basis. NOTE: A Disaster Can Evolve: An emergency may not be obvious, i.e., temperature, power, physical damage, fire, explosion, water, or vandalism. A problem may develop elsewhere in the building or the neighborhood that should be brought to the attention of a member of the Executive Management Team. Command Centers and Contingency Sites Command Centers In the event of a major or disastrous incident, a Command Center will be established from which all communications and activities will be directed. The Command Center will be used to coordinate the management of recovery procedures and will serve as the center of all communications between the Executive Management Team, other Recovery Team Leaders as necessary, and all other necessary personnel. The Command Center will be activated when disaster incident has occurred, especially when the personal safety of employees or property is jeopardized. This center will provide centralized and coordinated control of communications during emergencies. If conditions warrant closing of facilities, the Command Center will communicate the closing notice through the management chain and incident escalation and notifications procedure to all employees. The location of the Command Center must be communicated to all employees at the time of an incident. Potential Command Center Locations _Primary_ 1. A conference room at the affected location, if accessible (Rome or Griffiss Financial Center) _Alternate_ 1. A conference room at the other main back-office location (Rome or Griffiss Financial Center) _Contingency Sites_ In addition to the Rome and Griffiss locations acting as backup locations to each other, there is additional space to relocate people to Commercial Drive and Oneida locations. General Procedures for Specific Incidents The overall plan is designed to be flexible enough to be able to respond to any number of emergency situations \u2013 many of those where the specifics cannot be foreseen. However, there are a variety of specific emergency situations that can and do occur. For those, the following procedures have been developed. Blizzards/Inclement Weather Authorization to close will be given, as appropriate, if senior management feels it is appropriate to shut down company operations during normal business hours due to severe weather conditions or the imminent threat of such conditions. Should this decision be made, all areas will be notified via the automated emergency response system. The Incident Response Team will assume responsibility for: 1. Posting signs on the doors to all public areas to notify arriving members. 2. Assigning a responsible officer to ensure that each area is properly secured and that all personnel have departed. 3. Notifying all armored car and couriers making appropriate arrangements. 4. Implementing a pre-determined procedure for notifying personnel if the financial bank remains closed the next business day. If property damage occurs after banking hours and is discovered upon arrival at a facility, notify a member of the Incident Response Team who will assume responsibility for: 1. Assessing the extent of the damage. 2. Determining the appropriate actions to be taken and for notifying the proper authorities. 3. Determining if the facility should remain closed or should open for business at the next appointed time. 4. Implementing a pre-determined plan to notify personnel, as deemed appropriate. 5. Implementing the notification steps outlined above if the office is to remain closed. Electrical Power Failures Should your facility or department lose power, you should immediately notify a member of Incident Response Team. The Incident Response Team will assume responsibility for: Contacting the power company to determine how widespread the failure is, and when power is expected to be restored. 1. Ensuring the security of all company property and valuables. 2. Ensuring that no one is trapped in an elevator if there is an elevator in the building. If there is anyone in an elevator, assure him or her that arrangements are being made to get them out and notify emergency personnel. 3. Accounting for all personnel and members. 4. Preventing access to all areas of risk until the office is closed or until power is restored. 5. Preventing unnecessary movement of persons in potentially dangerous areas. 6. Determining what work can be accomplished and in what areas. When power is restored, the Incident Response Team will be responsible for: 1. Checking and resetting environmental timers for heating and cooling systems. 2. Checking and resetting power supply for cameras and any control lock areas. Testing exterior and interior protective lighting and building signs. 3. Testing and resetting alarm systems. Flood/Water If there is a continual downpour of rain that has the potential to reach a danger level or if you notice that water is entering in the building, you should immediately notify a member of the Incident Response Team. The Incident Response Team will assume responsibility for: 1. Directing the implementation of appropriate precautionary measures. 2. Moving essential records to a vault or protected site away from the affected area. 3. Shutting off the main water valve and main power if there are ruptured water lines. 4. Cautioning all personnel to be careful before walking on any floors covered with water as equipment power cords lying on the floor could cause electrical currents. 5. Contacting emergency services at 911, if appropriate. Tornado It is important for all personnel to know and understand the difference between a tornado watch and a tornado warning. The issuance of a watch or warning by the National Weather Service will determine what procedure is to be followed. A tornado watch is issued when atmospheric conditions are favorable for the development of severe weather or tornadoes. A tornado warning is issued when a tornado has been sighted and there may be danger to life and property if those in its path do not take protective measures. Any employee who becomes aware of either a tornado watch or a tornado warning is to immediately notify their manager, and a member of the Incident Response Team. The Incident Response Team will assume responsibility for assessing the situation and directing all personnel. A tornado may strike very quickly necessitating immediate action by area managers. All area managers are to have predetermined an appropriate course of action in such an emergency. Actions should include: 1. Determining a protected area of the building to protect the lives of those present. 2. Ensuring that all exterior doors and windows are secured. 3. Directing personnel to secure essential documents and valuables, time permitting. 4. Directing all personnel and members to go to the predetermined area for protection. 5. Ensuring there is no one near exterior glass or in any potentially exposed area. Determining a protected area of the building to protect the lives of those present. Explosions Any employee who becomes aware of an explosion or explosion warning should immediately notify their manager, and a member of the Incident Response Team. The Incident Response Team will assume responsibility for assessing the situation and directing all personnel. Employees should: 1. Evacuate the danger area. 2. Call emergency services at 911. 3. Notify the Incident Response Team as soon as safe and possible. Civil Disturbances Individuals or groups who resort to violent demonstrations within the community may subject the Credit Union to financial losses, property damage, and danger to employees and members. Employees should follow the below general guidance: Confrontations outside the office: 1. If confronted with civil disorders such as demonstrations, picketing, riots, and sit-ins, contact emergency services by calling 911, and then notify a member of the Incident Response Team as soon as it is safe and practical to do so. Confrontations inside the office: 1. If confronted with disturbances inside the office, notify their manager and a member of the Incident Response Team. 2. The Incident Response Team should caution everyone not to intimidate or provoke the demonstrators. 3. The Incident Response Team should contact the emergency services by calling 911. Nuclear, Biological or Chemical Accidents The widespread use of Nuclear, Biological or Chemical agents has increased the possibility of hazards from accidents with these materials. In case of an accident: 1. Evacuate the danger area. 2. Notify emergency services by calling 911. Law enforcement will notify the appropriate state and federal agencies. 3. Notify the Incident Response Team. 4. Evaluate the situation according to the location and severity of the accident and its proximity to personnel and members. 5. Cooperate with law emergency service officials. Bombs and Bomb Threats The identification of a bomb device is difficult; and disarming one should only be attempted by trained law enforcement. Extreme caution must be exercised if a suspect device is located. 1. Evacuate the danger area. 2. Call emergency services at 911. 3. Notify the Incident Response Team Is this an isolated circumstance? Notify the Incident Response Team If possible and safe, determine the following 1. Is the threat specific? 2. Is time imminent? 3. Is the threat plausible? Is the caller convincing? Is the danger avoidable? CAUTION \u2014 Do not touch or attempt to move a suspicious object. Preserve any material that may be used in an investigation. Small/Controllable Fires The following should only be attempted for very small and easily controlled fires. If there is any doubt to your safety, you should not do the following, but rather should immediately evacuate the building and call 911. Your safety and that of other employees and members is the highest priority. 1. Discharge/sweep the fire extinguisher towards the base of the fire. Fire extinguishers are located on each floor of all company properties. 2. Place important documents and diskettes in the vaults. Remember that many of the buildings are equipped with water sprinkler systems that can damage documents as well as extinguish fires. 3. However, if a fire develops beyond your control, follow the emergency evacuation procedure above. 4. If a fire is detected in the computer room shut off the master switch if it is safe to do so. Recovery Teams Executive Management Team The Executive Management Team will be activated at the onset of the incident and will remain active throughout the course of the incident. Responsibilities of this team include declaring a disaster, making key decisions related to the recovery effort and providing any type of support required by the recovery teams. BCP Incident Response Team The BCP Incident Response Team will be activated at the onset of the incident. Responsibilities of this team are specific to responding to an incident, assessing the damages, and activating the notifications procedures with the approval of the Executive Management Team. Technology Response and Recovery Team This team is responsible for all activities related to initializing the contingency site(s) in order to recover systems, applications, and people to resume critical business functions This team will be contacted at the onset of an event and will initiate responsibilities once the decision is made to declare a disaster and activate the BCP. Although the team is responsible for the recovery effort at the alternate site, they will remain active throughout the disaster to maintain systems and support users. Administration Team The Administration Team is responsible for assisting in the recovery effort on an as needed basis. The Administration Team will assist in providing logistical support during an incident. The Administration Team will be initiated at the onset of a disaster declaration and will remain active until the disaster is resolved and the Incident Log is completed. Business Unit Recovery Team The Business Unit Recovery Team is comprised of business managers from all critical business areas. They are responsible for all recovery issues related to their areas. This team will be activated at the onset of a disaster declaration for coordination purposes. They will assist in testing and certifying systems during the recovery effort in order to continue critical business functions from the contingency site. They will remain active until restoration at the production site is complete. Restoration Team The Restoration Team is responsible for all activities related to restoration of normal operations during the restoration phase of the recovery. This team will initiate responsibilities as early in the process as deemed necessary. Restoration activities may begin even as recovery efforts are in effect at the contingency sites. BCP Incident Response Incident Escalation and Notifications Any situation causing a loss of operations capability will be considered an \u201cIncident\u201d. Any incident should be recorded and tracked in the \u201cIncident Log\u201d. This \u201cIncident Log\u201d must be initiated by the Administration Team. This record of the incident will be important for documenting details for the insurance company as well as for future reference in case the incident occurs again. Once an incident occurs, the proper authorities (such as fire, police, medical, etc.) must be notified as necessary. Declaring a Disaster It is important to remember that an occurrence is first labeled an \u201cincident\u201d and not a \u201cdisaster\u201d. It is only referred to as a \u201cdisaster\u201d once the assessing of damages is complete, the findings are brought to the attention of the Executive Management Team, and the decision is made to declare a disaster and utilize the Contingency Sites. Many times, an incident is reported and contained and/or resolved before it requires escalation or before it causes a disaster situation. Events Declared as a Disaster 1. Proper authorities (Fire, Police, and Medical) must be contacted immediately as deemed necessary. 2. The Executive Management Team (see Section 3) The BCP Incident Response Team 3. The Administration Team to initiate an Incident Log 4. The Executive Management Team will ensure that regulatory agencies are notified as required 1. NYS Department of Financial Services (Part 749 Appendix) requires notification within five business days of any catastrophic event 2. NCUA (Letter 01-CU-21) requires that notification is made to the regional director within five business days of any catastrophic act The Executive Management Team and BCP Incident Response Team are to assemble at the designated Command Center or via Teams depending on the severity of the disaster. At the appropriate time, the Executive Management Team will decide when to begin notifications of the other recovery teams, branch managers, other credit union personnel, AmeriCU Credit Union partners, Board of Directors, and media. Each department manager will be contacted at the appropriate time to be apprised of the situation. It is the responsibility of each department manager to keep their department employees\u2019 contact information offsite in a secure location. They will be responsible for contacting their respective employees in an emergency situation. If the incident is classified as major or disastrous and a disaster must be declared, any contingency sites, drop-ship vendors, support vendors, and off- site storage locations must be notified. The Business Unit Recovery Team Members should be contacted as soon as it is deemed necessary to contact credit union personnel. This is particularly important for incidents that occur during non- business hours. It is the responsibility of each department manager to maintain a list of their department personnel\u2019s contact information offsite. The department managers will be responsible for contacting their employees under the direction of the Executive Management Team. When scheduled to be unavailable (e.g. vacation), it is the responsibility of each individual to notify each other as to whom his/her designate will be. Building Evacuation The Emergency Evacuation Procedures for the credit union are intended to ensure a safe and orderly evacuation response to emergency situations such as fire, bomb threat, or other condition that requires evacuation of a building. The procedures are to be implemented by the Executive Management and BCP Incident Response Teams as necessary at the time of an incident and should be in line with the credit union\u2019s formal Emergency Evacuation Procedures. BCP Incident Response Team General Responsibilities It is important to remember that any team member may invite other employees as required to meet the needs of the disaster. For example, the Chief Operating Officer may bring Marketing representation to the team if required. The outlined group of individuals is not intended to be all inclusive and the needs of the organization will be considered when assembling the teams.

Executive Management Oversight AmeriCU Credit Union recognizes their responsibility of engaging Executive Management in the Business Continuity Program to meet regulatory guidelines set forth by the FFIEC. Executive Management must support the program and participate in development, maintenance, and implementation efforts in order to ensure that the recovery process is efficient and effective at the time of an actual disruption. Executive Management and the Board are also responsible for reviewing and accepting the Business Continuity Plan on an annual basis. Executive Management Team Team Leader: Ron Belle Alternate Team Leader: Mark Livesey Other Members: 1. Dyana Herrig O'Neill 2. Bryan Delehanty 3. Alissa Sykes Tulloch 4. Jason Lewin 5. Karen LaPlante Purpose: The main purpose of this team is to determine the severity of the potential disaster by having the BCP Incident Response Team members report their results of the assessment of the damages to the facility. After reviewing these results, the Executive Management Team must decide if the situation requires a disaster declaration, causing activation of the Business Continuity Plan and initialization of the Contingency Site(s). This is an extremely important decision and has financial ramifications. This decision should only be made after a very careful and complete evaluation of damages has been made and it is determined that the situation cannot be contained or resolved. If a disaster is declared, the Executive Management Team remains in effect throughout the entire length of the disaster. They will remain in constant communication with the Team Leaders, particularly to assist as needed and assist or direct important decision making, will receive updated information when appropriate, and will offer support to each team when necessary.

As the organization changes, the plan will change. There are various components to the business that may change and warrant updates to the plan. These include, but are not limited to: 1. Personnel changes: Changes that affect team leaders, alternate team leaders, and team members 2. Technology changes: Organizations often change the systems, hardware and applications that support their business processes. 3. Regulatory requirements: Regulatory requirements can often change what must be recovered as well as recovery priorities 4. Business processes: Changes occur to the way organizations conduct daily business. These changes can affect the recovery plan and must be documented accordingly. 5. Service Provider/Vendor Changes: Third party service providers\u2019 change and can have an effect on the way daily business is conducted. Contact information for these must be reviewed on an ongoing basis. Testing Policy The Board of Directors and senior managers are responsible to establish an enterprise-wide business continuity testing strategy and test plans that set expectations for business lines and support functions. Testing will be performed at least annually. A multi-year test plan[A1] will be developed to cycle the technologies based on their criticality rating. Enterprise-wide test strategies shall be based on the Business Impact Analysis (BIA) and risk assessment and include the following: 1. Expectations for incorporation of business lines and support functions to demonstrate the achievement of business continuity test objectives consistent with the BIA and risk assessment. 2. The test plan shall be developed with consideration for multiple scenarios and will incorporate scopes of varying degrees. 3. A description of the depth and breadth of testing to be accomplished. 4. The involvement of staff, technology, and facilities, with specific, defined roles and responsibilities specific to test objectives. 5. Expectations for testing internal and external interdependencies. 6. An evaluation of the reasonableness of assumptions used in developing the testing strategy. It is the responsibility of MTS to schedule, execute, and document technology recovery tests. The BCP Coordinator is responsible for tracking test results, verifying tests are completed and notifying business lines of missed due dates. It is recommended that technology testing involve end users to help validate systems recovery and accessibility. It is recommended that tests include network applications and the use of more than one contingency site, whenever appropriate. Different applications will be periodically rotated during testing and telecommunications recovery testing will be included on a regular basis. In addition to technology recovery testing, walkthroughs of the BCP should be conducted with each recovery team on an annual basis to review plan details and identify necessary changes. These walkthroughs also facilitate awareness of the plan and the expected role of each of the team members. Other exercises for awareness and training should be considered and scheduled as appropriate. Simulation tabletop exercises should be conducted with wider audiences to test plan components and decision making in a non-stressful environment. Scenarios should be changed for each simulation exercise and should incorporate challenges with facilities, technologies, and personnel. Maintenance Ongoing Updates or Changes This policy should be updated at least annually, however, updates can be made at any time. Awareness and Training This policy should be trained to all employees at least annually as well as after any major changes to the procedure. Testing should be conducted at a minimum annually.

RESPONSIBILITIES Vice President, Information Security The Vice President of Information Security is responsible for all aspects information security and reporting of vulnerabilities to senior management. The Vice President of Information Security will have the final approval in accepting risk and deciding on false positives or false negatives. System Administrator The System Administrator is the individual or individuals who manage a system on which a process depends. System Administrators may install software, manage the security or operational configurations, and coordinate changes or access to a system. System Owner The System Owner is the individual responsible for the overall procurement, development, integration, modification, operation, maintenance, and retirement of an information system. The System Owner will typically be a department head who has responsibility for a system within a process. Types of Security Concerns Vulnerabilities - Vulnerabilities are software flaws or misconfiguration that cause a weakness in the security of a system. Vulnerabilities can be exploited by a malicious entity to violate policies - for example, to gain greater access or permission than is authorized on a computer. Remediation - There are three primary methods of remediation: Installation of a software patch, adjustment of a configuration setting, and removal of affected software. Threats - Threats are capabilities or methods of attack developed b malicious entities to exploit vulnerabilities and potentially cause harm to a computer system or network. Threats usually take the form of exploit scripts, worms, viruses, rootkits, and Trojan horses. Inventory Management The Information Security Team should use existing inventories of the organization's IT resources to determine which hardware equipment, operating systems, and software applications are used within the organization. Below is a representation of ownership for inventory management. The Information Security Team will also use a variety of tools to validate the results of the below groups and attempt to enrich the data with relevant information or add to the total inventory. Each device or software type should be inventoried by the appropriate group and added to the enterprise inventory. Device and Host Type Ownership Device Type | Group ---|--- DVRs/Network Cameras | Risk Mobile Devices | MTS Network Hardware | MTS Network Storage | MTS Telephony | MTS Physical Servers | MTS Printers/MFD/Scanners | MTS Software | MTS Virtual Servers/Desktops | MTS Workstations, Thin Clients | MTS Hardware Hardware will generally be owned and managed by the Infrastructure team. The Infrastructure Team will be responsible for patches and firmware fixes for all managed hardware devices. In some cases other departments may own their own hardware; in such cases, the owning department will manage the patches and firmware for those devices but may rely on IT for assistance. DVRs/Network Cameras Digital Video Recorders or Network cameras are video devices and their related recording systems. Mobile Devices Mobile devices will encompass laptops, chrome books, Mac PCs or laptops, mobile phones (Apple, Android, and Microsoft) and other portable electronic devices used to access AmeriCU systems. Network Hardware Network hardware will be defined as devices that are operationally required for the network to function. Examples of network hardware include routers, switches, firewalls, and VPN gateways, or any other hardware allows for logical networking. Network Storage Network storage will be defined as storage hardware that encases large amounts of shared storage and is only accessible through network access. Network storage may include standalone storage devices or unified hardware/storage devices. Telephony Telephony will be defined as devices related to telephones, voice mail systems, or related components that allow for long distance voice communication over the AmeriCU data network. Physical Servers Physical servers will be defined as a computer that manages access to a centralized resource or service. This will be a device that has a physical connection to the network. Printers/MFD/Scanners Printers, Multi-function devices, and scanners are critical document reproduction or imaging devices. Workstations and Thin Clients Workstations will be defined as end user computing devices. Workstations may include a full system with all resources in a single unit where the end user completes work. Thin Clients will be defined as minimalist workstations where work is not completed on the local device; the local devices connect to a network resource to perform work in a virtual manner on a remote resource. Software Software will generally be owned by the MTS team. In general, Information Security will patch operating system and productivity suite software. Some examples of software include encryption agents or remote support software. Virtual Servers/Desktops Virtual Servers and Desktops will be defined as servers and workstations that are configured to run in a shared environment on a remote network resource. A physical server may host multiple virtual servers or desktops using a shared set of system resources. Productivity Suites Productivity Suites will be defined as software that is required to complete basic document processing. Productivity suites include software such as Microsoft Office or Adobe Reader and their related components or more feature rich versions. Operating Systems Operating Systems will be defined as the software that supports a computer's basic functions, such as scheduling tasks, executing applications, and controlling peripherals. Examples of operating systems include Microsoft Windows, Linux, UNIX, Mac OS, or HPOS. Out of Band Management Out of Band Management will defined as the software or firmware that allows devices to be managed remotely and often after an incident or when a system is powered down. One form of out-of-band management is sometimes called lights- out management (LOM) and involves the use of a dedicated management channel for device maintenance. It allows a system administrator to monitor and manage servers and other network-attached equipment by remote control regardless of whether the machine is powered on, or whether an operating system is installed or functional. Asset Grouping and Prioritization The purpose of grouping device types is to assist with prioritization of vulnerabilities. The priority of each grouping is fluid depending on the risk or threat being addressed as well as other factors. In order to quickly and accurately identify systems with risks, like device types will be grouped and assigned an initial contact to assist in the remediation or mitigation of a risk or threat. Grouping Considerations 1. Device Type 2. Device Function 3. Device Location 4. Ownership 5. Risk profile Asset Description Assets should be described by a baseline of information. The below list is an example of some information that should be used to describe and enrich each configuration item. 1. DNS Name 2. Asset Tag 3. System Owner 4. System administrator 5. Physical location 6. Connected network port 7. Software configuration 1. Operating system and version number 2. Software packages and version numbers 3. Network services 4. Internet Protocol (IP) address (if it is static) 8. Hardware configuration 1. CPU Type 2. Memory 3. Disk space 4. Ethernet addresses (i.e., network cards) 5. Wireless capability 6. Input/output capability Vulnerability Identification Vulnerabilities will be identified by performing credentialed vulnerability scans. Credentialed host scanning involves collecting credentials from system owners for the sole purpose of scanning each device type. The collection of credentials can be either be a dedicated account granted to the system owner may enter the credentials manually into the vulnerability scanner. In either case, the account used for this type of scanning should have appropriate access to read the operating system of the device as well as the configuration. Monitor for Vulnerabilities, Remediations, and Threats The Information Security Team is responsible for monitoring security sources for vulnerability announcements, patch and non-patch remediation, and threats that correspond to the software within the organizational software inventory. A variety of sources should be monitored to ensure that the organization is aware of all newly discovered vulnerabilities. Software Software vulnerabilities can be monitored in many ways. The Information Security along with MTS teams should decide on the methods of monitoring for software vulnerabilities. In general, the group should subscribe to vendor mailings in order to receive critical vulnerability information. Another method of monitoring includes the use of automated tools that receive regular updates in order to identify vulnerable systems. Firmware Firmware vulnerabilities should be monitored in a similar way to software vulnerabilities. Most methods that are available to monitor for software flaws can be applied to firmware flaws. Using automated scanning methods is one of the quickest ways to identify threats and vulnerabilities in the environment. Monitoring Methods 1. Vendor websites and mailing lists 2. Third party websites 3. Third party mailing lists 1. US-CERT 2. FS-ISAC 4. Vulnerability scanners 5. Vulnerability Databases 1. Vulnerability database should contain at a minimum of the following: 1. Vulnerability Overview 2. Analysis 3. Solution 4. Exploit 2. CVE \u2013 Common Vulnerability and Exposure 3. CWE \u2013 Common Weakness and Exposure 6. Patch management Tools Prioritizing Vulnerability Remediation or Mitigation The Information Security team is responsible for classifying and prioritizing vulnerability remediation. In addition to industry standard scoring, AmeriCU applies a formula to assist in prioritizing or reassigning risk ratings based on additional factors; in these certain cases, an adjustment to that classification may be appropriate depending on some of the below factors: 1. End User 2. System Priority 3. Risk Profile 4. Business criticality When prioritizing remediation, it is important to determine some important information about the systems. 1. Determine the significance of the threat or vulnerability 1. Consider exposure 2. Focus on systems that are essential for operation 2. Determine whether there are active exploitations available for a given vulnerability 3. Determine the risk associated with applying a patch or non-patch fix. 1. Will the fix disrupt operations functionality? 2. What degree of disruption is appropriate? CVSS Scale 1. Below is the current CVSS version 3 scale for understanding the range associated with a particular rating. For highly detailed information about how CVSS is defined, visit First.org. Rating | Score ---|--- None | 0.0 Low | 0.1-3.4 Medium | 4.0-6.9 High | 7.0-8.9 Critical | 9-10 Remediation Testing Testing procedures should be well defined and built around a repeatable and testable process. Testing should occur in the same manner for every remediation that will be applied to all vulnerability groups. Prioritizing Remediation Prioritization of remediations will be handled in order of severity and impact. Critical severity and critical impact vulnerabilities must be remediated first and in descending order from VIP to Low, in accordance with this process, and related processes. Testing Environment Patch and non-patch fixes should be tested in a separate environment if available. This allows any major issues to be avoided in the production environment. If a testing environment is not available, testing targets should be well defined and encompass systems from each type of system that requires the patch. Testing targets should be made known to all stakeholders and should be tested on the same cycle. The testing cycle should also be well defined and made known to all stakeholders. Testing Targets Testing targets should be a pre-approved group of devices that encompasses all relevant aspects of information technology. The testing targets should also include a mix of devices that need both firmware and software fixes and contain a back out plan. Deploying Vulnerability Remediations Vulnerability remediation should be deployed to all systems that have the vulnerability, even for systems that do not have an immediate risk of exploitation. Remediations should be incorporated into the build process for all devices and the builds should be updated on a regular schedule. The three primary methods to remediate vulnerabilities from affected systems are installing software patches, changing system configurations, and software removal. Security Patch Installation Security patches are software fixes that are released by the software vendor. Software fixes update the code of the application to eliminate the vulnerability. Security software patches should be incorporated into the organizations patch management solution. Configuration Change Configuration changes are fixes that do not require a security patch to fix. Configuration changes may involve changing software or operating system settings or functions without needing to change the running code. Apply configuration changes to all relevant systems using a patch management solution or other enterprise application in bulk after testing the outcome on your testing targets. Software Removal Software removal involves removing software that is vulnerable. Assess whether a security patch or configuration change is available and whether or not the software is still required. If there is no security patch or configuration change available to remediate the vulnerability and the software is no longer required, uninstall the software. Deployment Methods Automatic Deployment Automatic remediation deployment is the preferred method of installing fixes. The automated solution should be robust enough to do large deployments of remediations in a short amount of time and inside of change windows. Automatic deployments allow for you to configure the parameters one time and apply them to many devices. Manual Deployment Manual deployments should be used when no automated method is available. Manual deployments involve logging into each device and performing the appropriate remediation. Manually remediating vulnerabilities is a time- consuming process that may require large amounts of documentation, always use automatic deployments when available. Risk Acceptance and Deferrals Risk acceptance by the System Owner may be a valid way to close vulnerabilities. System Owners will confer with the Vice President of Information Security in order determine that the threat is low enough to not warrant the effort to remediate, compensating controls exist to significantly lower the risk, or when the disadvantages of remediating the risk is outweighed by benefit. All risk acceptance and deferrals will be documented via a ticket and express in detail the specific devices and vulnerabilities that are being accepted or deferred. Deferrals can have a maximum of 6 months and may not be deferred again; at this point a vulnerability must be remediated or have its risk accepted by the system owner. Consider the below when deciding whether or not to accept or defer remediations: 1. Threat level 2. Risk of Compromise 3. Consequence of Compromise Threat Level Consider the following factors for what the threat level is for each specific risk: 1. Exploitation 2. Does the system face numerous and/or continuous significant threats? 1. Public web server vs internal web server 3. Insider threat vs external threat Risk Compromise Consider the following factors for what the risk level is for each specific threat: 1. What is the probability of exploitation? 2. What is the cost to the organization after exploitation? 3. What is the impact to the organization after exploitation? Consequence of Compromise Consider the following factors for what the consequences are for each specific threat: What are the consequences of a successful exploitation? 1. Root Access 2. Sensitive data access 3. Avenue for lateral attack to critical systems Verifying Remediation The final step in the Vulnerability Management Process is to verify that remediations and mitigations have been applied and are working as intended. There are several ways to verify the remediation, some examples are listed below: 1. Manually verify files or configuration settings have been applied as described by the vendor documentation 2. Use a vulnerability scanner to determine the vulnerability no longer exists 3. Review patch logs 4. Perform a penetration test against the formerly vulnerable device 5. This should ONLY be done under express approval from management and by professionals who understand the risk Vulnerability Scanning Vulnerability scanners are commonly used in many organization to identify vulnerabilities on their host networks. A vulnerability scanner identifies not only hosts and open ports on those hosts, but also associated vulnerabilities. A host's operating system and active applications are identified and then compared with a database of known vulnerabilities. All devices will be scanned at least quarterly for vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scanners can be of multiple types: 1. Network scanners are used to map an organization's network and identify open ports, vulnerable software, and misconfigured services. They can be installed on a single system on the network and can quickly locate and test numerous hosts. Network scanners are generally ineffective at gathering accurate information on hosts using personal firewalls, unless the personal firewalls are configured to permit the network scanning activity. Running vulnerability scanners frequently can be helpful in identifying new hosts on a network, as well as their vulnerabilities. 2. Host scanners must be installed on each host to be tested. These scanners are used primarily to identify specific host operating system and application misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. Host scanners have high detection granularity and usually require not only host (local) access but also a root or administrative account. Some host scanners offer the capability of repairing misconfigurations. 3. Web application scanners are used to interrogate web applications that are running on web servers. The purpose of these scanners is to test for common web coding flaws such as SQL injection. 4. Passive vulnerability scanners may be deploys to sniff network traffic as it travels across network. The sniffed traffic can then be used to determine application information and often times the version of the software. The information gathered then can be compared to the vulnerability database to determine if a vulnerability exists. Vulnerability scanners provide the following capabilities: 1. Identify active hosts on networks 2. Identify active and vulnerable services (ports) on hosts 3. Identify vulnerabilities associated with discovered operating systems and applications 4. Test compliance with host application usage/security policies. 5. Compare results against a vulnerability database Scoping Vulnerability scanning should encompass the entire scope of the network to include all hosts, and devices. Hosts should be scanned using credentials in order to get a full view of all software, firmware, and the configuration of the host. Vulnerability scanners should be kept up to date with the latest vulnerability database information to ensure that accurate results are returned. Internal Scan Internal scans denote a scan of hosts that are connected logically and physically internal to the firewall that separates the enterprise network from the Internet. External Scan External scans denote a scan of hosts are connected logically and/or physically external to the firewall that separates the enterprise network from the internet. External scans may be physically connected internally but are logically accessible from the internet. Types of Scans Credentialed Host Scan Credentialed scanning involves supplying the vulnerability scanner with an appropriately privileged account and password. This type of scan allows the scanner to remotely log into devices and scan for installed software, operating systems, and firmware; this information is then compared against the vulnerability database to assess whether or not vulnerabilities exist. This is the most comprehensive scan. This type of scan should be performed at least once quarterly where possible and on all available hosts and device types. Operating System Identification The operating system identification scan should be performed against all known IP spaces. This scan is to attempt to identify the operating system of devices only and is useful when populating the device inventory. This type of scan should be performed anytime a new subnet is created but after devices have been added to the subnet. This type of scan is generally safe to run at any time and should encompass known subnets in order to validate that only the approved hosts respond. Discovery Scan Discovery scans should be performed at a minimum once every 120 days and run against the entire enterprise IP space. This is a time-consuming scan and can take a long time to complete. Ensure that you have enough resources to complete this scan within 120 days. Discovery scans have vulnerability checks removed to ensure the scan completes in a timely manner, in a typical case, a discovery scan will be identical to an operating system identification scan with the exception of the subnet scope. Targeted Scan A targeted scan should be performed when validating remediations that have been addressed. Typically, a targeted scan targets a small number of assets for a specific vulnerability. This type of scan should be performed ad-hoc as required or after a patch cycle to validate the remediation. Application Scan An application scan is a vulnerability scan that is specifically targeted at hosted software or services. The purpose for these scans is to detect the presence of vulnerabilities in applications such as SQL injections, logic flaws, RACE conditions, DDoS susceptibility, or other issues. This is typically a scan that does not include credentials. This type of scan should be performed ad-hoc or according to any regulations that the application may be subject to. Verifying Patch Levels False Positives and False Negatives A false positive is when something does not actually exist but is counted in a measurement. A false negative is when something does exist but is not counted in a measurement. Enterprise patch management tools can encounter false positives even when they are working perfectly. For example, if a patch cannot be applied to a particular server, then the absence of the patch should not be counted in the metrics. Patch Responsibilities All responsible departments should assign a System Owner and Administrator to manage each type of system that they are responsible for. All System Owners should review patches for their system once a month, at a minimum. Information Security will assist by providing vulnerability reports as well as provide assistance, where it can, into remediation, recommendations, or compensating controls. In general, Information Technology will push the majority of security patches using an automated method. Information Security will be responsible for ensuring that the general operating system and basic software, to include major third-party software, is patched appropriately. In addition to these patches, Information Security will conduct automated vulnerability scanning and provide the results to the patch management group in order to make remediation decisions.

RESOURCES/REFERENCES N/A PREVIOUSLY KBID 5885 ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTORS N/A Appendix A AmeriCU Risk Appetite Statement Introduction: Founded in 1950 at Griffiss Air Force Base, AmeriCU is a member-owned credit union. We have grown to over $2.5 Billion in assets and more than 150,000 members throughout Central & Northern New York. AmeriCU offers our members the most convenience, services and value, all while continuing to provide outstanding service. AmeriCU is part of the credit union movement and works to embody the principles of \"people helping people\" and cooperative ownership. Everything we do is for our members and our communities. It's why we have lower loan rates, higher deposit rates, and support local charities and not-for-profit organizations. After all, we exist to provide our members the right financial services to live life, dream big and achieve financial success. Throughout our history, we have steadfastly maintained a community banking approach of personalized relationship-based service. As we have grown, maintaining this relationship-based approach utilizing local, talented and experienced teammates has been an integral component of our success. Our teammates leverage their local knowledge and relationships to deliver timely solutions to our members. Review and Approval: AmeriCU reviews this Risk Appetite Statement at least annually and adjusts according to the current and projected business environment as well as existing and emerging risks to the strategic plan and daily operations. Potential alterations are submitted to the CEO for consideration and a draft version is presented for ratification by the Board of Directors. AmeriCU Enterprise Risk Management Vision : Leverage the premier Enterprise Risk Management standard (COSO), Committee of Sponsoring Organizations, to develop a risk oversight and management program that enhances performance by optimizing risk taking opportunities that are aligned with this Risk Appetite Statement. General Risk and Strategic View : AmeriCU's three-year strategic plan and organizational culture focuses on sustained long-term growth and member value. Our strategic initiatives balance financial performance, regulatory compliance, active community outreach and to be an employer of choice in every community we serve. Our strategy links desired results with the business plan and budget, and rewards behavior aligned with the organization's risk appetite. We consider this risk appetite statement in strategy setting and periodically ensure alignment of business plans and risk assessment results with this statement. The organization's culture will focus on the identification, documentation, reporting, and management of risk in a manner transparent to all stakeholders; and we view this as a strategic imperative to facilitate informed decision making. This requires continuous engagement of all associates in visible and continuous (daily) risk identification and management. The organization further maintains a forward-looking view of risk to achieve its strategy while considering future risk. The organization is exposed to a variety of risks as it strives to achieve the goals and objectives set in its Strategic Plan. These risks will be identified, assessed and managed within a risk management framework known as our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Program. We operate under the broadly accepted Three Lines of Defense concept. This places risk ownership and management at the business unit level (first line of defense); the second line of defense has responsibility for ERM program design, management and providing guidance as well as challenge to the first line of defense; and Audit serves as the third line of defense to assess the control environment for first-line and second-line activities. It also encourages the principle of effective challenge across the organization. AmeriCU adopts the COSO definition of risk appetite as, \"the types and amount of risk, on a broad level, an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of value.\" The organization manages risk through the nine categories identified below to achieve transparent qualitative and quantitative awareness of risks it seeks to assume and to limit. Additionally, the organization recognizes the risk categories should be viewed as an ecosystem whereby all categories are interdependent. Each risk may impact some or all of the other risks independently and also impact the entire risk profile. This further emphasizes the need for a strong, dynamic risk management culture and ERM program that include prompt executive and Board (and/or Risk Committee) reporting when the appetite is exceeded. AmeriCU's 9 Risk Categories We recognize risk-taking as a necessary element in creating organizational value and therefore strive to manage risk in a disciplined manner across the categories below to achieve the desired outcome. We rate risk using a 5-point scale as follows: The table below summarizes our appetite for risk in each category and owners of each risk: Risk Category | Risk Appetite | Management Risk Owner(s) ---|---|--- Reputation | Very Low to Low | CXO Strategic | High | CEO Credit | Moderate | COO Liquidity | Low | CFO IRR, Market & Sensitivity | Moderate | CFO Compliance & Legal | Low to Moderate | CRO Operational | Moderate | COO Information Technology | Low to Moderate | CDIO Cyber | Low to Moderate | CRO While it is noted that primary oversight is provided by the outlined personnel, AmeriCU values teamwork and collaboration at every level above all else. These Leaders work in collaboration with each other and with various SME throughout the organization to make decisions that ensure AmeriCU is best positioned for the future. Risk Committee will monitor movement outside of RAS/Tolerance as set forth by the CLT/BOD. This will be discussed with the Risk Owner, based on the immensity of the movement outside the tolerance, within a set timeframe (TBD). Additional measures will be taken including, but not limited to, discussion with the CLT/BOD and the development of action plans to return to within the agreed upon limits, or the modification of said limits will be updated to bring the discrepancy back within tolerance. Reputation: Very Low to Low The risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital or franchise or enterprise value arising from negative public opinion. Our reputation is one of our most valuable assets. AmeriCU recognizes protecting our members money and providing capital is a high calling and is best achieved through a strong reputation. We therefore expect a high standard of ethical conduct from directors, management, associates, and key partners and will continually emphasize this as part of our culture and training. We will not knowingly do business with a client or service provider that could potentially damage our brand through association. We will promote our brand in our communities and support those communities as business and civic leaders. Prior into entering partnerships with third parties we will understand and assess our reputation risk including our ability to effectively monitor such relationships. Our reputation will be considered when making all key strategic decisions. Strategic : High The risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital or franchise or enterprise value arising from adverse business decisions, poor implementation of business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating environment. We are a member centric institution and realize the importance exploring new products and services that will enhance our ability to provide high value services to meet our members' needs. We will engage in activities we believe provide an appropriate return for the effort and capital deployed and we possess the expertise to effectively manage the risk within our appetite. We will leverage our Center of Excellence and take a disciplined, methodical, comprehensive approach when analyzing potential opportunities. We will obtain input from all key stakeholders from all areas of the CU as part of our analysis prior to finalizing any strategic initiatives. We will seek and engage in activities that are within our expertise and the capabilities of our internal environment. We will engage the expertise of trusted partners when specialized knowledge, not present in the organization, is needed to support our business. Credit: Moderate The risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from an obligor's failure to meet the terms of any contract with the financial institution or otherwise perform as agreed. We constantly review loan products to determine an appropriate risk to reward ratio while meeting the credit needs of our members. We will adhere to our credit culture in executing loans. We will not enter into lending activity that is beyond our capabilities to effectively manage the related risks. We will strive to maintain a diversified portfolio of safe and sound assets. Also, we will strive to maintain our underwriting standards through all business cycles so as not to sacrifice credit quality for growth. We will manage concentration risk prudently. We will strive for sound diversity across industries and product and collateral types. We will manage credit exposure using approved underwriting criteria and well- conceived approval levels and will proactively monitor and communicate the portfolio status. We strive to price loans commensurate with the level of risk. We will take on more risk if the price is appropriate and we have the expertise and mechanisms to effectively manage that risk. We use the AmeriCU Credit Policy as a guide and seek to ensure we understand our borrowers. We perform comprehensive due diligence prior to launching lending products to ensure we have the expertise to align the risk within our appetite. Liquidity : Low The risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from an inability to meet obligations when they become due. We are a member funded institution and will continue to emphasize balance sheet liquidity while ensuring we have alternate liquidity sources to address stressed scenarios. Funding for abnormal scenarios will come from stable, on and off-balance sheet liquid sources. We will strive to maintain a deep understanding of the stability and retention rates of our deposit base across a range of economic conditions. We will maintain a Contingency Funding Plan (KBID2153) to respond to potential stress events. Interest Rate, Market & Sensitivity: Moderate The risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from movements in interest rates and market prices. Our emphasis is on stable earnings, regardless of interest rates. Therefore, we will strive to protect the balance sheet from significant interest rate changes. However, it may be prudent occasionally to take on a moderate to high amount of interest rate risk, especially in times of extreme (high or low) rate levels. Our primary focus is on the impact to net interest margin in varying rate environments. Our interest rate sensitivity will be measured and reviewed no less than quarterly. Legal & Compliance: Low to Moderate The risk to current and prospective earnings or capital arising from violations of, or nonconformance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, internal policies, and procedures or ethical standards. We believe in doing the right thing. We believe adherence to laws and regulations as well as appropriate ethical behavior are not optional; and that appropriate guidance from the Board in the form of policies and directives supports our business objectives. We must have regulatory good standing in order to execute on our strategic plan. We acknowledge compliance risk and the potential for regulatory enforcement or penalties represents an asymmetric risk. Thus, we will invest as necessary in people and systems to mitigate this risk, as regulatory compliance is not optional. We will mitigate risk with continued efforts to enhance compliance through appropriate policies and procedures, internal controls, and effective training and communication. We are willing to take on compliance risk to support the desired business model but are unwilling to have that result in negative impact to the strategic plan, highlighting the criticality of strong controls, testing and remediation. We strive to maintain healthy and collaborative relationships with all regulatory bodies based on consistent communication and trust and will communicate regularly to accomplish this objective. Operational : Moderate The risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct, or adverse external events. We realize that operational risk is pervasive in all areas of the institution. Given the pervasive nature of this risk we seek to manage it through continued investment, training, and formalization of risk practices, including build out of the organization's enterprise risk management framework. We understand the need to develop and maintain a talent advantage through our ability to attract and retain well-qualified associates is vital to our continued success. Recruiting, compensating, mentoring, training and retaining associates are foundational in managing this risk. We will make investments in people (including appropriate training) and infrastructure in advance of undertaking new products, activities, or markets to reduce the risks in new or changing tactics. We will employ the right associates for the right job, and we will seek to establish depth at key positions along with succession plans so absence or attrition will not impair our ability to operate. We recognize the ability to develop and deploy timely and accurate management information is vital to our success. We invest significantly to gather complete and accurate information and deploy models to ensure accurate decision making. We will continue to focus on data quality prior to building out a formal data governance framework which will follow. We will invest in technology that will help effectively and efficiently operate our business. We will take proper steps to understand the risks that come with the adoption of technology and appropriately monitor and mitigate those risks. Some risks are inherent in our business such as fraud, information security breaches, loss of key personnel, disruptions of service, human error, internal control deficiencies, regulatory violations and more. We will invest in resources to adequately manage and monitor these risks. We will ensure appropriate business continuity plans and disaster recovery plans are in place, tested periodically and efficiently communicated to minimize the disruption in operations. Cyber & Information Security: Low to Moderate The potential risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from unauthorized access to or criminal us of networks, devices and data; and the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. We recognize this as a lofty and challenging risk level to achieve, given its highly dynamic nature and difficulty in obtaining insight on and applying correct controls to all true risks. Changes in the internal environment and ever-evolving threats make it imperative that we work cooperatively and proactively across the organization. We recognize threat actors may operate directly against the organization so we will work cross-functionally to evaluate risk as changes and incidents occur in our dynamic environment. We view malicious internal and external acts more seriously than unintentional human error. However, we recognize both for their potential risk. Therefore, we train our associates on cyber and information security risk and test their awareness. Our appetite for major system, data, network and similar incidents is low. We have a higher appetite for minor or quickly detected and remediated incidents resulting in little or no member or financial effects. We will identify and protect information assets, put in place the tools and processes to detect unauthorized access, respond to events with appropriate urgency and recover from events to ensure continued strong delivery of our services. We continually evolve our capabilities to match business needs and address the threat environment. We will strive to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data. We will mitigate Cyber/information security risk by combining our internal controls and monitoring with the strong controls of our trusted third parties, and this will include deployment of a strong oversight program. We will also prepare for, respond to and remediate identified issues. Resources, human and technical, will receive substantial investment; and change management, training and testing will be superior in order to achieve the desired residual risk.", "policystat_url_direct": "https://americu.policystat.com/policy/16101870/", "policystat_url_latest": "https://americu.policystat.com/policy/16101870/latest/", "policystat_url_guest_access": "https://americu.policystat.com/?lt=cEdmjq-OJYCVZNejpWpI-e&next=%2Fpolicy%2F16101870%2Flatest%2F", "tags": ["Board Approved"]}, {"name": "ACU-11-009 Incident Response Policy and Plan", "id": 16569015, "category_name": "ACU-11 Risk Management", "author_name": "Dupree, Anthony: VP, Information Security", "applicability_group_name": "AmeriCU Credit Union", "text_preview": "POLICY STATEMENT This document outlines the plan for responding to information security incidents at the AmeriCU, including defining the roles and responsibilities of team members, the overall characterization of incident response, relationships to other policies and procedures, and guidelines for reporting requirements. Due to the wide variety of incidents that could face the credit union and the rapid advancement of threats against the credit union, its data and systems, this document is designed to provide guidance in reacting to data security incidents, determination of their scope and risk, and ensuring an appropriate response to information security incidents, including communication of incidents to the appropriate stakeholders, and reducing the risk of the incident from re-occurring. Anyone suspecting an exposure of credit union data or systems should immediately contact: Vice President of Information Security \u2013 Anthony Dupree, Anthony.Dupree@americu.org, x3006 Chief Experience Officer - Dyana Herrig O'Neill, dyanah@americu.org, x3382 VP, Member Technology Delivery \u2013 Timothy Gianfreda, Timothy.Gianfreda@americu.org, x3248 DFS REQUIREMENT: AmeriCU must notify the superintendent pursuant to \u00a7 500.17(a) of certain Cybersecurity Events as promptly as possible but in no event later than 72 hours from a determination that a reportable Cybersecurity Event has occurred. 23 NYCRR 500.17(a) requires Covered Entities to notify the superintendent of certain Cybersecurity Events as promptly as possible but in no event later than 72 hours from a determination that a reportable Cybersecurity Event has occurred. A Cybersecurity Event is reportable if it falls into at least one of the following categories: (1) the Cybersecurity Event impacts the Covered Entity and notice of it is required to be provided to any government body, self-regulatory agency or any other supervisory body; or (2) the Cybersecurity Event has a reasonable likelihood of materially harming any material part of the normal operation(s) of the Covered Entity. An attack on a Covered Entity may constitute a reportable Cybersecurity Event even if the attack is not successful. DFS Portal: https://myportal.dfs.ny.gov/web/cybersecurity/ NCUA REQUIREMENT: 23-CU-07 Cyber Incident Notification Requirements All federally insured credit unions must notify the NCUA as soon as possible, and no later than 72 hours, after the credit union reasonably believes it has experienced a reportable cyber incident or received a notification from a third party regarding a reportable cyber incident. The 72 hours begins when the credit union forms a reasonable belief a reportable cyber incident has taken place. To report a cyber incident, the credit unions may notify the NCUA through one of the following channels: Call the NCUA at 1.833.CYBERCU (1.833.292.3728) and leave a voicemail; or Use the National Credit Union Administration Secure Email Message Center(opens new window) to send a secure email to cybercu@ncua.gov.2 The credit unions should be prepared to provide as much of the following information as is known at the time of reporting: Credit union name; Credit union charter number; Name and title of individual reporting the incident; Telephone number and email address; When the credit union reasonably believed a reportable cyber incident took place; and A basic description of the reportable cyber incident, including what functions were, or are reasonably believed to have been affected or if sensitive information was compromised. NCUA Reportable Incidents: The rule then defines a reportable cyber incident as any substantial cyber incident that leads to one or more of the following outcomes: A substantial loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a network or member information system that results from the unauthorized access to or exposure of sensitive data, disrupts vital member services, or has a serious impact on the safety and resiliency of operational systems and processes. A disruption of business operations, vital member services, or a member information system resulting from a cyberattack or exploitation of vulnerabilities. A disruption of business operations or unauthorized access to sensitive data facilitated through, or caused by, a compromise of a credit union service organization, cloud service provider, or other third-party data hosting provider or by a supply chain compromise. 23-CU-07 Cyber Incident Notification Requirements | NCUA describes in greater detail the description of reportable incidents. SCOPE This plan applies to all AmeriCU systems and processes, information systems, organizational data, and networks of the credit union and any person or device accessing these systems or data. The Vice President of Information Security acts on behalf of the credit union and will request cooperation and assistance in investigating security incidents from employees and team members as required. The Vice President of Information Security will also work closely with other credit union business units such as legal, human resources, member technology services, risk, and marketing in the investigation of incidents as necessary Maintenance The Vice President of Information Security is responsible for the maintenance and revision of this document. RESPONSIBILITY Vice President of Information Security Throughout the course of the protocol, the Vice President of Information Security is broadly responsible for: 1.

Throughout the course of the protocol, the Incident Response Coordinator is broadly responsible for: 1. Directing efforts to gather appropriate information. 2. Providing expertise in the procedural aspects of gathering information and documentation of process. 3. Updating security and other leadership as necessary. 4. The incident coordinator will assign a member of team as the incident communicator. Incident Response Communicator The Incident Response Communicator is responsible for updating members of the core team, and others as needed, of the status of an incident. The incident communicator shall work closely with, and be involved with the investigation so that they may have up to date information. Core team members shall update the coordinate with all changes to the incident, include scope and impact as they evolve. The incident communicator will be responsible for sending any communications to team members and the credit union as a whole as required. 1. It is the responsibility of all members of the incident response team to make a concerted effort to keep the communicator abreast of ALL changes and updates, major and minor, so an assessment of communication can be made. Incident Response Handler Incident Response Handlers will be assigned on a per incident basis. No specific assignment is needed, however any person fulfilling the broad responsibilities listed below will be considered incident handlers: 1. Gathers data from systems related to the incident. 2. Providing specific expertise in technology and data. 3. Reports appropriate data for incident management including procedural information. 4. Is involved in gathering or delivering information related to the incident. DEFINITIONS Event An event is an exception to the normal operations of AmeriCU, systems, or services that impact both members and internal employees. Events may be identified through the use of automated monitoring systems, employee reports, reported or discovered security violations, or in the course of normal system reviews, including system degradation/outage. It is important to note that not all events become incidents. Incident An incident is an event that, as assessed by incident response team, violates security policy, has widespread member impacts (greater than 10%), has widespread internal impact (major processes impeded), has regulatory impacts, or a critical system as categorized by the BCP experiences has an extended outage (greater than 60 minutes). Minor incident A minor incident is a narrow and limited scope event which is outside the normal mode of credit union operations. A minor incident requires a formal organizational response and may require that a large response team to be assembled for an effective response. If the data involved includes regulated data or PII it shall not be considered minor. Major incident A major incident is a wide scope or large-scale event that is clearly outside the normal mode of credit union operations. A major incident should always be declared when two or more scenarios (as defined below) are involved, or the incident is highly complex. Further, a major incident of the highest magnitude may require an invocation of the business continuity and disaster recovery plan. Incidents that include regulated data or PII shall be considered major incidents. The executive team may also declare an incident \u2018major\u2019 for any reason. Regulated Data Regulated Data may have additional reporting and regulatory requirements when dealing with incidents. Examples of the various types of regulated data that may reasonably be found in the credit union environment are further detailed in Appendix C. PROCEDURES This plan outlines the general tasks for Incident Response. Due to the ever- changing nature of incidents and attacks the incident response plan may be supplemented by specific internal guidelines, standards, and procedures as they relate to the use of security tools, technology, and techniques used to investigate incidents. Evidence Preservation The primary goals of incident response are to contain the incident and reduce the risk to institutional systems and data and to return affected systems and data back to an operational state as quickly as possible. The ability to quickly return systems to operation may at times be hampered by the collection of data necessary as evidence in the event of an exposure of data. All evidence in an incident must be preserved in some manner; the system owner is responsible for the actual collection of evidence and presentation to the incident response team. Training The continuous improvement of incident handling processes implies that those processes are periodically reviewed, exercised, and evaluated for process improvement. AmeriCU staff will be periodically trained on procedures for reporting and handling incidents to ensure there is familiarity with the process and with the responsibilities of the Incident Response Team. These exercises may take the form of either external or internal training including tabletop exercises. Incident Declaration An incident may be declared by ANY member of the core or executive teams. Events will be promptly shared with all members of the core incident response team simultaneously to ensure all members receive the notification. The core team members will have up to 30 minutes to decide on declaring the event an incident. Once a determination has been made, the event will become an incident, an incident response meeting will be called with the core and executive teams, and the incident response phases will begin. Incident Response Phases The Incident Response process encompasses six phases including preparation, detection, containment, investigation, remediation, and recovery. In the execution of responding to an incident, the Incident Response Team will focus on ensuring the detection, containment, investigation, remediation and recovery steps are followed closely and documented. Preparation Preparation for incident response includes those activities that enable the organization to respond to an incident and include the creation and review of policies, standards and guidelines supporting incident response; security and technology related tools; effective communication plans and governance. Preparation also implies that the credit union has implemented the controls necessary to enable the containment and investigation of an incident. As preparation happens outside the official incident process, process improvements from prior incidents should form the basis for continuous improvement at this stage. Detection Detection is the identification of an event or incident whether through automated means with security and technology tools or notification by an inside or outside source about a suspected incident. This phase includes the declaration and initial classification of the event/incident. Containment Containment of an incident includes the identification of affected hosts or systems and their isolation or mitigation of the immediate threat. Communication with affected parties is established at this phase of incident response. Investigation The investigation phase is when Vice President of Information Security/MTS personnel determine the priority, scope, risk, and root cause of the incident. During the investigation phase the team works toward discovering the who, what, where, when, why, and how of an incident and documents all information and discoveries. The investigation phase will reveal information that either confirms or disproves the incident. Remediation Remediation includes the repair of affected systems and services, addressing residual attack vectors against other systems, communication, and instructions to affected parties and an analysis that confirms the threat has been contained. If the Vice President of Information Security or Chief Risk Officer reasonably believes that an exposure of regulated data has occurred, the Vice President of Information Security or Chief Risk Officer will contact the legal department to provide situational information in determining a proper response. Recovery The recovery phase is used to verify all systems have been recovered and any data or affected processes are restored back to normal operations. The recovery phase additionally includes the analysis of the incident for possible procedural and policy improvements. The recovery phase is also when lessons learned are identified in order to prevent future incidents. Root Cause Analysis Once the incident is contained and normal operations have returned to normal the incident response team will meet to discuss the root causes of the incident. The analysis will cover each aspect of the incident and seek to understand the cause and controls that can be implemented to prevent future incidents. Apart from any formal reports, the after-action analysis will be completed at this stage. APPENDICES Appendix A \u2013 Executive Response Team The Executive Response Team is responsible for actions such as communication, information sharing, and minimizing impact from an exposure of regulated data. As the credit unions response to each incident may vary, this section provides an overview of those actions that the Executive Response Team may take in responding to an incident in which regulatory data has been exposed. Once it is determined that enough information about the situation and the extent of the exposure has been collected, the Manager of Information Security will collaborate with the general counsel to determine if the incident rises to the level of a security breach. In the event that this is determined, appropriate members of the ERT should work together to determine what, if any, level of notification is required, how individuals impacted by the exposure should be notified and what, if any, services should be offered to the individuals impacted by the data exposure to help protect themselves from potential or actual identity theft. If it is determined that notification and credit monitoring protection is appropriate and/or required, the credit union may engage with our cyber-liability insurance carrier for assistance. Where required by state and or federal law, the credit union will ensure that appropriate entities (NYDFS, NCUA, etc) are notified of the exposure, who has been impacted, and the credit union\u2019s course of action related to managing the exposure of data. Where necessary or appropriate, the ERT will expeditiously collaborate to develop press releases, letters to affected individuals (by email and/or U.S. post). Where appropriate, the Manager of Information Security will coordinate with credit union marketing team to create web page(s) with information regarding the exposure and how individuals can take steps to protect themselves. The ERT will also designate a single point of contact to address questions/concerns of individuals concerned about the exposure. In the course of managing and remediating the exposure, as expeditiously as possible: 1. Work with vendors to process any appropriate paperwork (i.e., SOW, PO, etc.) to engage the vendor\u2019s services. 2. General Counsel and the vendor to draft notification letters, and where appropriate, regarding the incident, may include notifying auditors or members. 3. The Manager of Information Security will work with appropriate Credit union staff to collect the names and last known addresses of individual who will need to be notified. 4. Notification letters will be sent to impacted individuals or organizations. 5. Press releases will be finalized and issued by the Marketing department where appropriate. The main Credit Union website(s), faculty/staff web page will include a link to the news release. 6. A special website, containing information regarding the exposure, how to get more information, and how to protect one\u2019s credit, may be posted as appropriate Marketing. 7. Once proper notifications have been sent and posted and the matter has been contained and handled, debriefing meeting(s) should be held with all of the individuals involved in the incident investigation, management and remediation. Additional follow-up activities should occur as appropriate. Appendix B \u2013 Guidelines for Incident Response Each incident presents a unique set of challenges and problems. This section provides some common guidelines for preferred actions in these types of events. For any issues outside of these guidelines, the Chief Risk Officer or the legal team should be consulted. Incidents within Chain of Command In incidents where a member of the incident response team, their leadership or the leadership of the credit union is being investigated, appropriate resources will be selected to remove any conflicts of interest at the direction of or in conjunction with either the legal team or the Board of Trustees. Interactions with Law Enforcement All communications with external law enforcement agencies are made after consulting with the legal team. Communications Plans All public communications about an incident or incident response to external parties outside of the Credit union are made in consultation with the legal team and Credit Union. Private communications with other affected or interested parties should contain the minimum information necessary as determined by the Incident Coordinator or Vice President of Information Security. Privacy The Credit union respects the privacy of all individuals, and wherever possible the incident response process should be executed without knowledge of any individual identities until necessary. Documentation, Tracking and Reporting All incident response activities will be documented to include artifacts obtained during any investigation. As any incident could require proper documentation for law enforcement action, all actions should be documented, and data handled in an appropriate manner to provide a consistent chain of custody for the validity of the data gathered. Based on the information gathered, a SAR (Suspicious Activity Report) may be required. Stipulations of such notification will include suspicion an employee or customer has engaged in insider trading activity; detects evidence of computer hacking; or a consumer operating an unlicensed money services business. SAR notification must be filed within 30 days of the event. Escalation At any time during the incident response process, the Vice President of Information Security may be called upon to escalate any issue regarding the process or incident. The Vice President of Information Security in consultation with the general counsel will determine if and when an incident should be escalated to external authorities. Appendix C \u2013 Regulated Data In the event of a breach of PII or regulated data AmeriCU may choose to issue a credit monitoring service code to our member(s). Codes will be released via the Risk Department as outlined in the procedure named \u201cParameters for Use of Equifax Identity Theft Protection Codes.\u201d Personally Identifiable Information (PII) PII is defined as a person\u2019s first name or first initial and last name in combination with one or more of the following data elements: 1.

SCOPE All AmeriCU Employees DEFINITIONS Security and Operations Manual - AmeriCU security is committed to providing a safe work environment for all employees and a secure financial institution for all members. Visitors are defined as any non-AmeriCU employee. Restricted Areas are Non-public areas within a credit union office restricted by doors and swipes that are locked and activated at all times. RESPONSIBILITY The Chief Risk Officer has the responsibility and authority to oversee this security program. 1. Statement on Security The AmeriCU Security and Operations Manual contain policies and procedures as required by the National Credit Union Administration. All policies and procedures contained herein are meant to protect all Credit Union Offices from robberies, burglaries, and larcenies. Most of all, the manual is designed to act as regulatory guidance to promote employee and member safety during any situation that may compromise the safety of our fellow employees and members. AmeriCU Security is committed to providing a safe work environment for all employees and a secure financial institution for all members. This manual will be updated annually in accordance with the regulatory laws of New York State and in adherence with any regulatory changes required by the National Credit Union Administration. 2. Program Overview This security program was developed to comply with the requirements of section 205(e) of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1785(e)) and Part 748 of Title 12 of the code of Federal Regulations promulgated by the National Credit Union Administration. Additional policies that fall under this program are ACU-11-003 Member Information Protection Policy and ACU-11-021 Guidance on Response Programs for Unauthorized Access to Member Information and Member Notice. 3. Program Administration The Chief Risk Officer is charged with the responsibility and authority to oversee this security program, which is outlined below: Initial development of a written security program and subsequent modification of such security program as circumstances or revised federal regulations may require. Implementation of security procedures and internal controls prescribed by the security program. Selection, testing, maintenance, and operation of security devices prescribed by the security program. Protection of vital records at each credit union office. Provision of initial and periodic training of employees and officers in their responsibilities under the security program, and in proper employee conduct during and after a robbery, burglary, or larceny. Monitoring the effectiveness of the security program and periodic security audits at each credit union office. Consultation with local law enforcement agencies to develop coordinated robbery and burglar alarm response plans for each credit union office. Such other responsibilities as assigned by the President /CEO or the Chief Risk Officer. 4. Controls 1. _Internal Controls_ Credit Union Management has adopted written plans of the organization and operating procedures to safeguard its assets, check the accuracy and reliability of its accounting data, promote operational efficiency, and encourage adherence to the prescribed managerial policies of this credit union. Many of these internal controls are designed to protect the credit union against crimes of embezzlement and are included by reference as part of this security program. 2. _Accounting Controls_ The Board of Directors has adopted an accounting system in accordance with the Accounting Manual for Federal Credit Unions and generally accepted accounting principles. The system incorporates internal controls to provide reasonable assurance that: Transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorization Transactions are documented and recorded promptly to permit accurate preparation of financial statements and to maintain accountability for assets Access to assets is permitted only with management's authorization The recorded accountability of assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to differences 3. _Control of Currency Levels_ The Chief Financial Officer will determine and assign maximum currency levels to each Financial Centers (FC). It is the responsibility of FC Managers to review and monitor their FC cash level to ensure that currency is maintained at or below the authorized or approved cash level. Maximum currency levels for the Management of each FC will be established for Member Service Specialist II (MSSIIs). FC Managers are responsible for assuring that their authorized or approved cash level is not exceeded. If a MSSII accumulates currency over the assigned amount, the excess will be transferred to a locked vault, safe, or another secure place at the earliest possible time. Random audits of MSSII currency levels will be made to ensure that each MSSII will be checked daily. Excess currency violations will be reported to the Internal Auditor. 4. _Dual Controls and Segregation of Duties_ It is the policy of AmeriCU Credit Union that management assigns duties to employees and departments so that no one person may dominate any transaction from inception to termination. In addition to this formal segregation of duties, teams of at least two employees will exercise dual control under the following circumstances: When deposits from night depositories and ATMs are retrieved and posted During audits of vaults, safes, cash drawers, unissued negotiable instruments, and cash funds When preparing and verifying currency being shipped or received 5. _Key and Combination Control_ The Fraud & Security Analyst, or his/her designee will ensure that the number of electronic swipe cards supplied to employees at each office is kept at a minimum. A record of electronic swipe cards will be maintained in a secure location on the intranet by the HR Manager or his/her designee. The Facilities Manager or his/her designee will ensure that the number of exterior door keys supplied to employees at each office is kept at a minimum. A record of keyholders will be maintained in a secure location by the Facility Manager or his/her designee. All excess keys will be kept in a locked box in a secured area. The AVP, Specialty Banking & Fraud Prevention will conduct an audit of all credit union office keys and electronic swipe cards on a risk-based approach. Employees will return office keys and electronic swipe cards when they are transferred or when their employment is terminated. If a terminated employee fails to return swipe cards or keys for any reason or is otherwise suspect, the HR Manager or his/her designee will notify the Fraud & Security Analyst, or his/her designee to delete the swipe card from the system(s) and the Facilities Manager or his/her designee to change the lock(s) as applicable. Dual control will be maintained over vault access at each FC. Knowledge of combinations and possession of keys necessary to open the vault, ATM, Recycler, CDM, etc., will be split between teams of two employees. No single individual should ever possess knowledge of or have both halves of a combination of keys to any vault, ATM, Recycler, CDM, or any other equipment that is designed with a system of multiple combinations for access. An appropriate number of teams will be assigned to each office to ensure access when employees are absent. Access to the vault will be logged at each FC. The initials of each team member responsible for maintaining dual control must be recorded on the vault access log. 5. Audit Policy The Supervisory Committee shall oversee a full-time, continuous program of internal auditing, as well as an annual outside audit by a firm of independent public accountants. 6. Personnel Policies 1. Prospective employees of the credit union will be screened for criminal history. The screening will include asking appropriate questions on application forms and during interviews, checking all references provided by the applicant, and if deemed necessary a drug test may be required before employment. 2. All employees responsible for currency or negotiable securities must telephone their supervisor to explain all absences from work. 3. If an absent employee fails to telephone and explain an absence, the employee's residence will be called to determine the reason for the employee's absence. 4. If telephone verification cannot be made, the employee's cash drawer will be counted immediately. 5. After the second day of an excused absence, the employee's cash drawer may be counted. 6. Management of each credit union office will rotate teller stations and some duties of office personnel to the extent such rotations are practicable. Personnel may be rotated on an unannounced basis. 7. Security Policies and Procedures General Safekeeping Policy/AmeriCU's Minimum Safeguards for the Safekeeping of Member's Information Procedure: These are the minimum safeguards that AmeriCU has in place: 1. _Identity Verification_ Opening Account Information procedure (found in the Knowledge Base article 387) is strictly followed under the USA Patriot Act. Change of Address Procedure (found in the Knowledge Base) ensures identity verification prior to the change and a confirmation of the address change is sent to both the new address and the address of record when the member is not present or identification is not physically verified in a FC. The system will automatically add on Account Warning: \"Address Changed Within Last 30 Days.\" Members calling the credit union to discuss their accounts are required to positively identify themselves as authorized users on the account. Prior to account information given, the credit union requires personal information from the member (for example, mother's maiden name and date of birth). The automated calling service has a built-in safeguard that requires callers to enter a personal identification number (PIN) that has been chosen by that individual. If the identity of the caller is not certain, no information will be divulged. 2. _Password Protection_ Members accessing their accounts by automated teller machines (ATM)/Kiosks, debit cards, home banking, Internet delivery channels, or automated telephone banking services are required to have either User Name and Access Code or Access Code/PIN password protection. Passwords are chosen and changed by the member. 3. _Disclosure of Information to Third Parties_ AmeriCU does not give share or loan references to third parties without written authorization from the member. No member information is divulged without their written & signed request. There are certain circumstances outlined in AmeriCU's Privacy Statement and Information Requests (found under the Knowledge Base), where information may be provided to the extent permitted by state or federal laws and regulations. 4. _Funds Availability Verification_ Check funds availability will not be given over the phone unless the party calling can provide the account number. This will only allow verification that the check will be honored/dishonored at the time of the call. Balances and other information will NOT be provided. 5. _Restricted Employee Access to Information_ AmeriCU restricts access of certain member information to authorized employees. Teller privileges are determined and set on the Symitar transaction system. Privileges are reviewed on an annual basis. In addition to restricting member information on the Symitar system, physical access to and throughout the building is also restricted. The security swipe access system allows controls to be set to prevent non-employees from gaining access to restricted areas. The swipe access system provides the ability to separate buildings into zones to determine necessary/unnecessary employee access to member information and/or departments. 6. _Control of Computer Access_ Computer access and employee passwords are strictly controlled. Written policies and procedures are in place to ensure that employees with computer terminals that can be viewed by the general public take extra care to sign off the system when away from their desks for any length of time. Password-protected screen savers are required for employees with network access. Employees select their own system passwords and are encouraged to exercise extreme caution. The system forces employees to change their passwords periodically and prohibits them from repeatedly using the same password. Monitoring systems and procedures are in place to detect actual and attempted attacks on or intrusions into customer information systems. Personal Computers and electronic media that are removed from service are reformatted prior to disposal. Hard drives are drilled or punched prior to disposal. 7. _Security of Records_ Departments with sensitive records, such as loan applications, signature cards, and consumer reports, ensure that filing cabinets are locked when appropriate and other necessary security measures are taken. Lockable vaults are utilized to house and secure confidential information. Employees with face-to-face member contact keep all confidential information secured and away from unauthorized access. Most documentation is imaged prior to disposal. Master files are backed-up each night and the backup files are stored off- site. 8. _Social Media_ It is recognized that social media platforms offer specific privacy and security challenges due to their public bi-directional nature. AmeriCU takes diligent steps to tightly restrict the use of social media for disclosing sensitive or personal information while keeping such systems useful for open member communication and marketing purposes. No AmeriCU employee may post any content to a social media platform on behalf of (i.e. representing) AmeriCU Credit Union without content review and approval from a Social Media Reviewer. Social Media Reviewers are the Communications Coordinator and the VP of Member Relations & Marketing. Social Media Reviewers may review and approve their own content. All other employees may use social media in their own time, but must always represent themselves and not give the impression of speaking on behalf of the Credit Union. Similarly, a Social Media Reviewer must review and approve direct responses to members who post content, comments or questions to social media platforms. In the event of significant negativity, reputation attacks, or other potentially harmful activities within social media, employees must refer to AmeriCU's Crisis Communications Plan for guidance (MMR retains this plan). 9. _Disposal of Member and Consumer Information_ AmeriCU retains services from a company that specializes in the proper disposing/destroying of confidential information. Any consumer report, record or compilation of records about (or that identifies) an individual, whether in paper, electronic or another form that is maintained or otherwise possessed by AmeriCU for a business purpose, will be appropriately disposed of when necessary. All discarded reports and other confidential information is securely stored in locked bins until it can be destroyed. Shredding is done on-site and AmeriCU is provided with a certificate of destruction. 10. _Introducing new services_ We institute procedures to protect member information each time we introduce a new product, open a FC, or offer a new delivery system for retail products. We monitor and adjust our policies and procedures to reflect changes in technology, products, and the physical amenities of our credit union. 11. _Periodic testing_ We conduct periodic testing of our policies and procedures (annually or as needed) and report the results of these tests to our board or an appropriate committee. 12. _Service providers_ Steps are taken to ensure that all third-party providers can safeguard our member's information in a reasonable manner as outlined in the ACU-11-011 Third-Party Risk Management Policy. 8. Safekeeping of Currency, Valuables, and Vital Records 1. All currency, negotiable securities, and other valuables will be stored in a locked, burglar-resistant vault or safe during non-business hours. 2. Vital records at each credit union office will be stored in a locked, fire-resistant vault, record safe, or container during non-business hours. 3. 3 Vital records include: Cash journals and other books of original entry General ledger and supporting subsidiary ledgers, including members' individual share and loan ledgers Loan notes and supporting documents if the loss of such instruments would preclude the credit union from collecting the outstanding balances of the loans Securities, certificates, and other documents, which are evidence of investments, owned by the credit union Minutes of the Board of Directors, Investment Committee, and other committees which represent the historical actions of management; The credit union's charter bylaws, and related amendments. 4. Blueprints or specification documents for credit union offices, vaults, and any other structures in which currency or other valuables are stored or handled will be kept in a secure area at a central location. 9. Opening and Closing Policies 1. _Opening Procedures_ Note : There may be exceptions to the procedure due to financial center staffing and location. The regional Assistant Vice Presidents of Financial Center Operation will approve all exceptions. Opening Procedure Two employees must be present prior to entering the financial center. Upon arrival and prior to entering the building, the designated employees must visually inspect the exterior of the building, from the safety of their vehicle, for signs of forced entry. Should there be a sign of forced entry the employees will not enter the building and will telephone the police. If an inspection reveals no signs of forced entry, one employee will enter the building and relock the door. The second employee will remain outside of the building in a vehicle. Once inside, the designee will inspect all interior areas of the building for signs of intruders, signs of burglary, or other criminal activity. Should there be no signs of criminal activity an \"all-clear\" signal will be positioned in the designated area. (Each financial center has specific designated areas and all-clear\" signals) The utilization of an \"all-clear\" signal, indicating safe building passage to employees. Employees waiting outside of the building will determine that the \"all-clear\" signal has been properly displayed before leaving their vehicle or approaching the entrance of the building. The second designated employee may now enter the building. The building doors are to be locked after admitting the arriving employees. If the all-clear signal is not present after (a reasonable amount of time, which will be delegated per financial center), the second designated employee must phone inside the building to see if there is a response from the first arrival, if none, the police must be telephoned immediately. The employee will not enter the building. The designee in the building should use the word CODE in a sentence if contacted by the employee waiting outside of the building by phone (if they forget to place the \"all-clear\" signal, and are phoned by the second designee)The word \"CODE\" will ensure that it is safe to enter and that the employee is safe inside. The designee, in the building, will not use the word CODE, if in danger, and is forced to answer the phone; this will alert the second designee to contact 911. 2. Additional Information No unauthorized personnel will be admitted to the building prior to opening for business. Vendors that need to enter the building prior to opening for business should be verified by contacting the employee authorizing their access to the building. The authorizing employee will sign the vendor into the visitor log and escort the vendor through the building. The member access door will remain locked until the financial center is opened for business. Vaults and safes will be opened at the latest practicable time prior to the start of business in the presence of two employees or more. Employees wishing to enter the building without their access swipe, due to misplacement or damage of the card, will need to be authorized by human resources or the employee's supervisor prior to entrance. Discloser of the proceeding procedure details to non-employees is not prohibited. 3. Closing Procedures Management for each FC will create a closing procedure for their location consisting of the following guidelines: All employees are instructed to be especially alert for strangers or suspicious behavior at the end of the business day. Employees will report to management any suspicions immediately. Employees will actuate surveillance cameras. At closing time, the building doors will be locked. A designated employee will be stationed at the door to assist any remaining members as they leave the office. The door will be re-locked after each member leaves. No unauthorized personnel will be admitted into the credit union office after the doors are locked. All vital records will be stored in a fire-resistant record safe, container, or vault at the earliest practicable time. All information concerning our membership is to be cleared from view and placed in a secure location. All currency, negotiable securities, and similar valuables will be secured in the credit union office vault or safe at the earliest practicable time. The designee will check all areas of the credit union office where these items are normally handled or stored to assure that all valuables have been secured. All areas that are opened to the public need to be inspected to ensure that all members have left. All exterior windows and doors need to be securely locked. All security devices intended for non-business hours have to be utilized including all alarms, lighting, cameras, locks, and \"all-clear\" signals. For building-specific procedures, see 10.04B Headquarters & Griffiss Building Enter/Exit Summary. 10. Transportation of Currency by Armored Car 1. All currency to be shipped will be double-counted and strapped under dual control, and each employee involved in the count will initial the straps. 2. The currency will not be released for shipment until armored car personnel has been positively identified. 3. If credit union employees do not know the guard, the guard's identity will be verified by telephone with the armored car company. The guard should not be told that his identity is being verified by telephone. 4. A signed receipt will be issued for each shipment sent or received. 5. Currency shipments received will be bulk counted in the presence of the armored car personnel unless the count is guaranteed by the armored car agency. 6. Each shipment will be verified under dual control and secured in the vault or safe immediately upon receipt. 11. Servicing Remote and Financial Center (FC) ATMs All remote and most FC ATMs are serviced, replenished, and alarmed by third- party vendors. Whenever a service enters a remote ATM they need a code to shut off the alarm and they need to phone their headquarters for verification purposes to get an electronic code to enter the machine. The electronic code changes every few minutes as an added security feature. 12. Servicing Financial Center (FC) ATM's FC's that need to service ATMs will utilize the dual control system in which two employees will retrieve deposits and service all ledgers and/or receipt tapes from the machine. All FC's are equipped with proper lighting in ATM areas. All building structures are checked, all grasses are mowed, all snow is plowed, and all flowers and shrubs are trimmed and inspected continuously pursuant to the ATM Safety Act, to ensure safe usage by members. All FC ATMs are equipped with video surveillance pursuant to the ATM Safety Act. All surveillance is checked monthly unless reported or requested. 13. Visitor Identification and Access to Restricted Areas 1. To ensure the safety of AmeriCU employees and property and to help all personnel distinguish between employees and visitors, the following process must be followed to ensure all visitors have been identified and checked in appropriately when accessing or entering non-public restricted areas. All visitors must report to the front receptionist desk when entering the premises. A logbook will be maintained to document all visitors requiring access to restricted areas at each AmeriCU facility (FC or building). The logbook will record the date, name of the visitor, visitor's company, visitor's signature, front desk personnel initials, hosting employee's name or department, and time of arrival and time of departure. The logbook will be maintained in paper form for ninety days at the financial center. After ninety days the log will be destroyed. 2. The front desk personnel will verify the identification and company affiliation (picture id, company id, or business card) of the visitor and contact the hosting employee for further authorization. All visitors requiring access to restricted areas will show identification prior to receiving a temporary visitor badge that clearly marks them as visitors, where restricted areas are located. The hosting employee should make every effort to notify the FC that they will be expecting a visitor prior to their arrival. If the hosting employee does not notify the financial center that they are expecting a guest, the financial center must contact the hosting employee or their supervisor prior to completing the guest log entry and assigning a visitor badge. Front desk personnel will assign a visitor badge when the visitor signs in at all facilities. Badges are to be worn by authorized visitors at all times. Visitor badges are designated for visitors only and do not include swipe access cards. 3. The host employees will be responsible for managing their own visitors to ensure that they have been processed appropriately. They must redirect any visitors that have not acquired a badge to the front desk location. Hosting employees will be responsible for escorting visitors to the front desk to surrender their badges and log their time out of the facility when exiting the premises. The logbook will be reviewed at end of the day as part of the Financial Center's closing procedure. If the visitor does not surrender their badge or log out at the end of the day Risk Services must be notified. 4. There may be instances where the visitors (employed by vendors) have a confidentiality agreement with AmeriCU, which will give them the authority to be unaccompanied while in facilities or remain in facilities after business hours. If a visitor employed by the vendor that has a confidentiality agreement with AmeriCU is in a facility during business hours, the visitor procedure will need to be followed; presenting identification and signing in and out on the visitor log. If there is a question about visitor access authority contact Risk Services or Facility Maintenance. 5. AmeriCU requires that all non-employee visitors attending an organizational or community event register with us using our Visiting Organization Event Information Log-in sheet. The host-employee organizing this event will be responsible for managing all visitors in attendance. Badges will not be distributed to these visitors. This log will record the event name, visiting organization and contact information, AmeriCU hostname and department, event date, time the event started and ended, the visitor's name, visitor's signature, company event, and time signed in. AmeriCU will utilize these records for tracking purposes of documenting all special event visitor access. 14. Safe-Deposit Security Policy 1. Each FC which offers safe-deposit box rentals will adhere to the following: Before providing access to the vault, each renter's identity will be positively verified. Signature files will be checked even if the member is known, to assure that access is currently authorized. A credit union employee will escort the renter to the vault. Under no circumstances will a member be left alone in the vault. A credit union employee will never handle a member's key or safe deposit box unless it is in full view of the member. The member must always accompany the employee into the vault to access the box. After the box is accessed, the box door will be locked. The renter's key will remain in his possession. A member is not permitted to leave his box unattended in the coupon booth. If the member needs to leave the booth to transact business elsewhere in the credit union, the box must be secured in the vault. If further access to the box is required, standard procedures will be followed. Coupon booths will be inspected immediately following each use. Any article found during an inspection will be delivered to the designated credit union official in charge for the day and maintained under dual control. 15. Safekeeping of Office, Vehicles, Equipment, and Supplies Procedures 1. All spare keys and the titles to office vehicles will be secured in a vault or safe. 2. All credit union vehicles will be locked with the keys removed when not in use. 3. Office supplies will be kept in a locked cabinet and allotted to employees on an as-needed basis. 4. Employees will report missing office equipment or other valuables to their managers immediately. 5. The number of keys to credit union vehicles will be kept to a minimum and a record of all keyholders will be kept in a secure location. 6.

The AVP, Specialty Banking & Fraud Prevention or other responsible credit union officer will report all such incidents promptly to the President/CEO or Chief Risk Officer unless the President/CEO or the Chief Risk Officer is suspected of the crime. 4. Records of such crimes and supporting documentation will be kept for at least ten years from the date of the report. 18. Procedures for Operation of Surveillance Systems 1. Surveillance cameras located in each credit union office will be activated at all times. 2. Designated credit union employees will receive training in operating the surveillance cameras. 3. If a surveillance camera is not working properly, has been destroyed, or needs repositioning, it must be reported to management immediately. 19. Procedures for the Maintenance of Bait Money 1. Bait money will be kept at each teller station and in the vault or safe where the currency is kept at each credit union office. 2. Bait money will consist of used Federal Reserve Notes in nonconsecutive order with no obvious markings. If the notes are strapped, the dated strap will be kept current. 3. All Tellers will be trained in the proper use of bait money. 4. Periodic audits of bait money will be conducted at each FC on a random basis. A record of these audits will be maintained. Auditing will report any bait money violations to the AVP, Specialty Banking & Fraud Prevention. 5. A record of bait money listing the denomination, bank of issue, series year, and serial number for each note will be kept in a secure location away from currency and other valuables at each FC. The preparer and a second employee who verifies that the record is correct will sign the record. 20. _Height Reference Markers_ 1. Height reference markers or visible strips of tape at a six-foot height will be installed on doorframes at all FC entrances. 2. All MSSII will be trained to use these markers to estimate a suspect's height. 21. Rubbish Retention Procedures 1. Confidata bins (shred bins) are provided for confidential material that needs to be destroyed. All employees are advised to place all information that is retrieved from the Symitar system into a designated Confidata bin. The Internal Auditing Department may write up any department for not destroying confidential information in the proper way. This report will be forwarded to management and dealt with accordingly. 2. All departments will adhere to record retention schedules as required by Federal and New York State law specific to the department. Most records will need to be stored and kept for up to seven years unless otherwise imaged. This will vary depending on the department. 22. Security Training Policy 1. It is the policy of AmeriCU Credit Union to provide a program of initial and periodic security training for each officer and employee as prescribed herein. 2. Risk Management Staff will receive initial and periodic training designed to foster effective administration of this security program. This training program will keep the Risk Management staff apprised of current industry standards for security devices and security-related compliance issues. This training may include, but not be limited to: Periodic consultation with law enforcement officials. Membership in professional security organizations and attendance at organization meetings. Subscription to trade journals dealing with security and compliance. Periodic consultation with security consultants or security equipment vendors regarding current industry standards for security devices and procedures. Attendance at security training seminars or classes. Maintenance of a nationally recognized security professional certification. The HR Training Department will develop and implement a program to provide initial and periodic training to employees of their responsibilities under this security program, including proper employee conduct during and after a robbery, burglary, or larceny. Employees newly hired or transferred to a new position will complete a security segment pursuant to their assignment. FC Managers will review robbery procedures with their staff on a monthly basis. 23. Employee Response to a Burglary or Larceny-Alarm Not Sounded 1. Each employee will be expected to follow this procedure upon the discovery of an apparent burglary or larceny: Immediately report the apparent crime to the AVP, Specialty Banking & Fraud Prevention, or other designated credit union official, and local law enforcement officials and cordon off the crime scene. To protect physical evidence, avoid disturbing or handling any object the criminal may have touched. Cooperate with the police investigation. Do not speak with any media. Discuss the crime only with designated credit union and law enforcement officials. 24. Burglar Alarm Response 1. Each AmeriCU FC/Building will have a list of employees who have keys or electronic swipe cards to the office and are authorized to respond to a burglar alarm. The list will include employees' telephone numbers. One copy of the list will be filed with the local police department and one copy of the list will rest with the alarm monitoring system. The list will be updated annually and involved employees will have a list. 2. When a burglar alarm is sounded, the police or monitoring service will contact an employee on the call list to assist in the alarm investigation. Responding employees: When contacted by the police or monitoring service, you must first review camera footage to determine if it is a false alarm and whether police should be dispatched. If determined to be a false alarm, let the alarm company know that they can cancel the police response. If determined to be a valid alarm, respond to the FC/Building, waiting in a locked vehicle a safe distance from the building for police arrival. After the police have surveyed the exterior of the FC/Building for signs of forced entry, permit their access to the facility and assist in their investigation when they indicate it is safe to do so. Use extreme caution because an intruder may be hiding in the office. Conduct an interior inspection of the FC/Building with the police. Thoroughly examine all areas of the vault or safe for signs of forced entry. If a burglary has been attempted or committed, immediately notify the AVP, Specialty Banking & Fraud Prevention. Cooperate with the police investigation. To protect evidence, avoid disturbing or handling any object the burglar may have touched. Discuss the crime only with designated credit union officials and law enforcement officials. 25. Robbery 1. _Employee Conduct during a Robbery_ In the event of a robbery, the safety of employees and members is of primary importance. All employees will be trained to follow this procedure during a robbery. Remain composed-try not to panic. Avoid sudden movements or any action that might provoke the robber. Follow the robber's commands exactly without hesitation or resistance. Avoid taking any overt actions other than those ordered by the robber. Activate the silent alarm, panic, or duress button, only after the robber leaves the building, to avoid a possible hostage situation. If the robber demands a certain amount of money, surrender the exact amount. Do not volunteer additional currency or information about where additional funds are stored. Include bait money if it is safe to do so. IF the robber says not to include bait money do not include it. If a note is passed, handle it carefully. Hold it near the edges to preserve fingerprints. Set the note aside. Return it only if the robber asks for it. Be observant. Memorize the robber's features, voice, clothing, weapon, and any other characteristic, which may be useful for identification. Remember everything the robber touches and report it later to the police. If more than one robber is present, concentrate on the nearest one. 2. All FC's have robbery procedures as layouts vary and differ from one location to the next. See No. 10.01A \u2013 Support Services Robbery Procedures for (non-branch) building personnel. 3. _Employee Conduct after a Robbery-Victim Teller or Employee_ Actions to be taken immediately following a robbery: Actuate the silent alarm after the robber has left the building, even if it has been actuated once before. Lock cash drawers to secure any remaining cash or valuables. Notify the manager that a robbery has occurred as soon as it is safe to do so. After the robber has left the building, carefully approach a window or door to observe the direction of escape. Observe any accomplices or witnesses outside. If a vehicle is used, try to obtain its description and license plate number. Discuss the robbery only with designated law enforcement and credit union officials. Complete a written description of the robber. Ident-A-Card forms are available at all FC's. Do not leave the building. Back offices or conference rooms should be utilized. 4. _Employee Conduct after a Robbery-Manager or Supervisor_ After a robbery, the following actions should be taken by the manager, supervisor, or designated employee. In the event the designated person is absent or incapacitated, another employee may be required to fulfill these responsibilities. All FC Management, MSSII's, and MRA's will be trained to follow this procedure: Lock doors immediately after the robber leaves. Lock Cash Drawers. Secure all remaining Currency and Valuables. Designate an employee to call the police and the AVP, Specialty Banking & Fraud Prevention. Protect physical evidence the robber may have left behind. Rope off the area where the robber stood to protect footprints. Prevent anyone from disturbing anything the robber may have touched. Place an \"All-Clear\" signal in the door and drive-up windows for local law enforcement. Designate an employee to calm witnesses and to record the names, addresses, and telephone numbers present at the FC at the time of the robbery. Supply them with an Ident-A-Card to complete. Ask members to remain until the police arrive. If a member insists on leaving, verify his identity and record his name, address, and telephone number. Discuss the robbery only with designated law enforcement and credit union Officials. Employees should not leave the building after a robbery has occurred. Back offices and conference rooms should be utilized. The AVP, Specialty Banking & Fraud Prevention is to coordinate an investigation with appropriate law enforcement, employees, and members. 5. _Employee Conduct After a Robbery-All Remaining Employees_ All employees are to follow this procedure after a robbery: Remain at workstation unless told otherwise. Try to catch a glimpse of a fleeing robber at a safe distance away from a window. Complete a description form of the robber, if you saw him. Discuss the robbery only with designated law enforcement officials and credit union Officials. Do not leave the credit union office, unless your manager knows where you can be contacted. 26. Security Devices 1. All security devices are to be tested on a monthly basis at each FC. This report is known as the Monthly FC Security Report. This report must remain under dual control at the FC's. Duress buttons, cameras, digital surveillance, bait money; teller latches and doors, emergency building lighting, and any suspicious behavior must be logged on the report. The FC Manager is responsible for collecting, reviewing, authorizing, and forwarding the report to the Imaging Department no later than the fifth of the following month. FC's are required to report any equipment that is not working, so that it may be fixed promptly. 2. All FC's are equipped with: Vaults, appropriate safes for storing and locking currency. A lighting system for illuminating, during the hours of darkness, the area of the vault if the vault is visible from the outside of the credit union office. Tamper-resistant locks on all exterior doors and windows that may be opened. Burglar alarms. Silent alarms and duress buttons. All FC ATMs are equipped with cameras. Digital or CCTV continuous recording devices inside the FC's and in the drive-ups. Emergency lighting devices. Motion detectors and sensor alarms for prohibited areas. 27. _Procedure for Selecting Security Devices_ 1. The AVP, Specialty Banking & Fraud Prevention will oversee the selection of security devices for each FC, subject to Senior Management approval. In making selections, the following factors will be considered: The incidence of crimes in the area in which the FC is located. The location of the nearest law enforcement authorities, guards, and security personnel and the time required for such personnel to arrive at the FC. The amount of currency or other valuables exposed to robbery, burglary, or larceny. Other security measures are in effect at the FC within the area. The physical characteristics of the FC structure and its surroundings, including the physical vulnerability of the building itself and visual obstructions nearby caused by architectural or landscaping features, might provide places for criminals to hide. The size of the FC and the number of its employees. Whether the device meets or exceeds industry standards. The cost of the security device. The Information Technology Department will be consulted for minimum hardware requirements related to information security and IT operation needs such as network access and integration, monitoring, backup and recovery, alerting, power supply, and change management procedures. 28. _Requirements for Video Surveillance Cameras_ 1. The camera should be positioned in accordance with industry best practices. All public or member-accessible operating areas of a financial center should be adequately equipped with video surveillance (cameras). In addition, per regulation (NYS, PCI DSS) data center operations, card processing, and all ATMs are required to have sufficient video surveillance and data retention. 29. _Video Surveillance Data Retention_ 1. Payment Card Industry Requirement 9.1.1 \u2013 Requires the use of video of cameras or other access control mechanisms to monitor individual physical access to sensitive areas. Camera records are to be retained for a period of at least 90 days. Note: Sensitive areas refer to any data center, server room, or any area that houses systems that store, process or transmit card holder data. Cameras located in sensitive areas (Debit Card & IT) at AmeriCU will retain camera records for a period of at least 90 days. 2. Other cameras in place at AmeriCU including cameras at branches, ATM's or other non-sensitive areas will retain camera records for a period of at least 45 days (reference Part 301.5 - NYS banking regulations.) 30. _Operation of Security Devices_ 1. Appropriate personnel at AmeriCU FC/Buildings will be trained by their Managers on how to operate the security devices. Such training shall include: The arming and disarming of AmeriCU FC/Buildings Viewing software of the Digital Video Recorder (DVR) A schedule indicating when each security device should be turned on and off Visual and operational inspection of security device controls to ensure they are working properly 2.

Any transactions, such as transfers of funds, to or from these countries or to blocked persons are prohibited. AmeriCU Credit Union is required to block such transfers and accounts and to furnish reports on all blocked accounts and rejected funds transfers to OFAC. This policy is adopted in order to ensure compliance with applicable OFAC requirements. SCOPE All AmeriCU Employees AVP, Specialty Banking & Fraud Prevention BSA & Fraud Department Deposit Operations Member Services DEFINITIONS N/A RESPONSIBILITY Management and members of the Board of Directors of the Credit Union support the Credit Union\u2019s commitment to the success of the its OFAC Sanctions Compliance Program. Adequate resources and support will be provided to ensure the Credit Union creates and administers a comprehensive compliance program in order to comply with OFAC requirements. All AmeriCU employees must complete annual OFAC and Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) training. Guidelines 1. OFAC - Office of Foreign Asset Control Regulations 1. The AVP, Specialty Banking & Fraud Prevention will act as the Credit Union\u2019s OFAC Advisor. Duties include: Contacting OFAC directly to verify any possible matches. Updating the credit union on any changes in OFAC regulations. Filing any reports that are required pursuant to OFAC regulations including suspicious activity, suspicious transactions, and wires. The Credit Union does not conduct wires for non-membership. Conducting an OFAC Risk Assessment to ensure that our policy and procedures are commensurate with our level of risk. 2. The BSA & Fraud Team along, with Deposit Operations, Member Services and Lending, will carry out the day to day functions of the program as follows: Member Services will process account applications and run CHEXSYSTEMS on all names at account opening and generate a report on any potential matches found pursuant to OFAC. Member services and the Lending Team will also run OFAC scans on non member transactions. Potential matches will be addressed according to the procedure and documented as necessary. Deposit Operations will scan all names on wire transmittals prior to transmitting and also will conduct OFAC screening on ACH transactions. A BSA & Fraud Team member utilizes BSA/AML software (BAM+ Scan) to screen AmeriCU's database to the current watch lists. Scans are conducted on all new accounts daily. A full database scan is completed weekly. The BSA & Fraud Team member reviews the generated alerts (with a threshold of 85%) that signal a potential match. 3. In connection with the Credit Union's commitment to establish policies and procedures to prevent money laundering, the Board of Directors also establishes this OFAC Policy which administers a series of laws that impose economic sanctions against target hostile foreign countries to further U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives. These laws are reviewed periodically by the BSA & Fraud Department. 4. The ownership for the transaction monitoring software (BAM+) and OFAC Screening (multiple system) model resides in the purview of the BSA Officer and AVP, Specialty Banking & Fraud Prevention. 5. The Criminal Code, at 18 U.S.C. Section 1001, provides for five years imprisonment and a $10,000 criminal fine for knowingly making false statements or falsifying or concealing material facts when dealing with OFAC in connection with matters under its jurisdiction. 6. Our credit union will block fund transfers that: Are remitted by or on behalf of a blocked individual or entity. Are remitted to or through a blocked entity. Are remitted in connection with a transaction in which a blocked individual or entity has an interest. 7. Our credit union recognizes that every credit union transaction is potentially subject to blocking under OFAC regulations. 8. U.S. law requires that assets and accounts be blocked when such property is located in the United States, is held by U.S. individuals or entities, or comes into the possession or control of U.S. individuals or entities. 9. If our credit union receives instructions to make a payment that falls into one of these categories, we will execute the payment order and place the funds into a blocked account. A payment order cannot be canceled or amended after our credit union has received it. Once assets are blocked, we will only release them by specific authorization from the US Treasury. We will report all blocks to OFAC within ten days of occurrence. 10. To ensure our credit union's compliance with the OFAC rules, the Board of Directors charges the AVP, Specialty Banking & Fraud Prevention through the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) with the duty to administrate the OFAC requirements including the responsibility of the day to day functions. The AVP, Specialty Banking & Fraud Prevention will report directly to the Bank Secrecy Act Committee concerning compliance reviews of credit union functional areas, regulatory examination reports and answers to those reports, impact of new or changes to existing consumer protection regulations, and general compliance issues and concerns. Specifically, the BSA & Fraud Department is responsible for: Maintaining current copies of applicable compliance statutes, regulations, interpretations; and knowing where to access the current list of Specially Designated Nationals, Specially Designated Drug-Traffickers, and Specially Designated Terrorists. Formulating and updating credit union policies and procedures to maintain credit union compliance with applicable compliance statutes, regulations, and interpretations. Oversight of the training of credit union personnel on credit union compliance policies and procedures. Monitoring blocked funds if any. 11. Independent testing of the OFAC Program will be conducted by an outside party on an annual basis. OFAC model validation will be conducted periodically.

Federal law provides for severe penalties for persons participating in a violation of the currency reporting requirements. Per part 748 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations, the compliance program must be approved by the credit union's Board of Directors and reflected in the minutes of the credit union. SCOPE All AmeriCU Employees Assistant Vice President, Specialty Banking & Fraud Prevention DEFINITIONS Bank Secrecy Act - Regulations designed to prevent and expose illegal money laundering to the federal government. RESPONSIBILITY The Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for the Bank Secrecy Act compliance. The Assistant Vice President, Specialty Banking & Fraud Prevention is appointed as the Bank Secrecy Act Officer by the Board of Directors and is responsible for managing credit union compliance with all of the federal and state laws relating to the Bank Secrecy Act, Anti-Money Laundering Program including oversight of the training of credit union employees on the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act. The board is responsible for ensuring that the appropriate people and resources are available to the BSA Officer. It is the responsibility of the BSA Department to monitor day-to-day compliance with the detection and prevention of money laundering. The Board of Directors, Management and Staff of our Credit Union are committed to implementing policies and procedures that assist us in detecting and preventing money laundering or other illegal activities conducted through transactions at our Credit Union. GUIDELINES 1. Currency Transaction Reports Credit union employees involved in a reportable transaction are responsible for completing the Currency Transaction Report (CTR). The CTR Reviewer will verify and approve the CTR(s), which will be electronically filed according to regulatory guidelines set forth by FinCEN. The acknowledgment received from FinCEN will be stored for proof of filing. Shared Branching transactions will be handled in accordance with the Shared Branching Transaction Guidelines. 1. _Currency Reporting Requirements_ The Bank Secrecy Act requires that all credit union transactions with a person involving currency, which total more than $10,000 in one day be reported on a Currency Transaction Report (CTR) and filed with the appropriate office of the U.S. Treasury no later than fifteen (15) days after the date of the transaction. A report is required not only on individual transactions of more than $10,000 in currency but also anytime there are multiple transactions in any one day that total more than $10,000. The transactions subject to reporting include deposits, withdrawals, exchanges (of checks for cash, for example), or any other transfer of receipt or delivery of currency by the credit union. The credit union must not only report the individual conducting the transaction, but also the person on whose behalf the transaction was conducted. For example, reports for currency deposits or withdrawals made for a corporation will include the name of the individual making the deposit or withdrawal as well as the name of the corporation. In addition, if a credit union employee involved in the transaction has reason to believe that an individual conducting a reportable transaction is doing so on behalf of another person; the employee shall inquire as to the individual on whose behalf the transaction is being conducted. For example, where a real estate broker deposits more than $10,000 in cash into a broker's trust account and the credit union has reason to believe that the money is being deposited on behalf of a client, the credit union employee should inquire as to the identity of that client and complete the CTR accordingly. 2. _Identification of Individual Conducting Transaction_ Before completing any currency transaction for which a CTR is required, the credit union will verify the identity of the individual conducting the transaction by reviewing the individual's appropriate identification. If the individual indicates that he or she is an alien or not a resident of the United States, the transaction can be completed only if they present an official document evidencing nationality or residence as identified in the Opening Non-Resident Alien/Resident Alien Accounts procedure. In all other cases, the identification of the individual shall be verified by examining the individual's driver's license, or if the individual has no driver's license, the transaction can be completed only if the individual presents some other form of identification, which the credit union accepts when cashing checks for non-depositors. If the individual is a known member of the credit union with the above identification information verified on a signature card, identification need not be verified at the time of the transaction. However, the driver's license number or other document identifying number must be obtained from the signature card and included in the Currency Transaction Report. Notations such as \"known member\" or \"signature card on file\" are prohibited and cannot be given as a method of identification. 3. _Member CTR Exemptions_ The credit union may, but is not required to, automatically exempt the following entities: A bank, to the extent of its domestic operations. A department or agency of the United States, of any state, or of any political subdivision. Any entity established under the laws of the United States, of any state, or of any political subdivision, that exercises governmental authority on behalf of the United States, any state, or political subdivision. Any corporation whose common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, or the NASDAQ stock exchange (except stock listed on the Emerging Company Marketplace of the American Stock Exchange or NASDAQ Small-Cap Issues). Any eligible non-listed business after either the business has been a member of the credit union for 2 months or after conducting a risk-based analysis of the legitimacy of the member's transaction, conducts five cash transactions per year over $10,000 and is incorporated or organized under the laws of the United States or a state. Any eligible payroll member after either the payroll member has been a member of the credit union for at least 2 months or after conducting a risk-based analysis of the legitimacy of the member's transaction, operates a business that withdraws five cash transactions per year over $10,000 in order to pay its U.S. employees, and is incorporated or organized under the laws of the United States or a state. A \"payroll member\" is defined solely with respect to withdrawals for payroll purposes from existing exemptible accounts. 4. The credit union will designate non-listed businesses, eligible payroll members, and corporations whose common stock is listed on the above Stock Exchanges by filing FinCEN Form 110 \"Designation of Exempt Person\" completed in the manner prescribed by the regulation, with the Internal Revenue Service. The credit union will file each exempt designation 30 days following the first transaction of currency in excess of $10,000 between the credit union and the entity. 5. For non-listed exempt members and payroll members, the credit union will maintain a monitoring system in order to be able to detect suspicious activity and determine that the member is still eligible to be exempt. Only those non-listed members who do not derive more than 50% of their business from an ineligible business activity are qualified to be exempt from reporting. Ineligible business activities are: Serving as financial institutions or agents of financial institutions of any type. The purchase or sale to members of motor vehicles of any kind, vessels, aircraft, farm equipment, or mobile homes. The practice of law, accountancy, or medicine. The auctioning of goods. The chartering or operation of ships, buses, or aircraft. Pawn brokerage. Gaming of any kind, (other than licensed pari-mutuel betting at race tracks). Investment advisory services or investment banking services. Real estate brokerage. Title insurance and real estate closings. Trade union activities. Any other activities specified from time to time by FinCEN. 6. _Credit Union Policies as to Exempt Members_ The credit union will treat all transaction accounts of a member as a single account so long as all of the accounts qualify for an exemption. One of the accounts may have money from prohibited activities outlined above. The credit union may treat a sole proprietorship as a non-listed business or payroll member as long as it meets all of the other exempt member requirements. The credit union will exempt only the business accounts, not the personal accounts of the sole proprietor. The credit union will not knowingly file false or incomplete information or attempt to exempt a member that the credit union has reason to believe does not meet the stated criteria. 7. _Monitoring Exempt Members_ The credit union will not file a \"Designation of Exempt Person\" form (FinCEN 110) or review annually for customers who are depository institutions, U.S. or State governments, or entities acting with government authority; The credit union will annually review and verify the information that supports the designation of a member as exempt and the credit union's procedures to monitor the member to ensure that any suspicious activity is reported. The credit union will take steps that a \"reasonably prudent\" credit union would take to assure itself of the proper identity of the exempt member and to protect itself against fraud or loss based on misidentification of the person's status. Factors the credit union may consider in order to form a reasonable belief include, but are not limited to: Whether the credit union had a past relationship with the member; Certain specific characteristics of the member's business model that may be pertinent; The types of business in which the customer engages; and where the business is operating. 2. Purchase of Monetary Instruments 1. Members including non-members of the Shared Branching Network may purchase monetary instruments. The credit union will maintain records of monetary instruments sold for currency in the amount of $3,000-$10,000. The credit union will file a CTR for deposits of more than $10,000 in cash for the purpose of purchasing a monetary instrument. 3. Prohibited Conduct 1. It is illegal for any person to structure transactions with the credit union to evade the reporting requirements. It is also illegal for anyone to assist another person in structuring transactions to evade the reporting requirements. Therefore, credit union employees will not assist any person in structuring transactions to avoid a currency transaction report. 2. If a credit union employee suspects that a person is purposely structuring transactions with the credit union to evade the reporting requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act, these suspicions should be reported to the BSA & Fraud Department. If a violation is suspected, a Suspicious Activity Report form will be filled out and electronically filed according to regulatory guidance set forth by FinCEN. 3. All Suspicious Activity Reports will be reported directly to the Board of Directors or through the Supervisory Committee, as soon as practical after filing. 4. Funds Transfers 1. Whenever the credit union accepts a payment order for a funds transfer in the amount of $3,000 or more, as the originator's bank, we will obtain and retain for five years the original, microfilm or other copy or electronic record of the following information relating to the payment order: The name and address of the originator. The amount of the payment order. The execution date of the order. Any payment instructions. The identity of the beneficiaries or recipients' bank. 2. In addition, we will retain as many of the following items as received with the order: The name and address of the beneficiary or recipient. The account number of the beneficiary or recipient. Any other specific identifier of the beneficiary or recipient. 3. AmeriCU will obtain the following data if it transfers funds for non-established members: Documentation of the originator's identification and the number of the identifying document). The originator's taxpayer identification number or lack of such number. When payment orders by non-established members are not made in person, we will obtain and keep all the information previously listed, plus a copy or record of the method of payment for the fund's transfer. If we know that the person requesting the transfer is not the originator, we must record all of the above information for the originator, as well as for the person conducting the transaction. For each payment order that we accept as the beneficiary's bank, we will retain the original, other copy, or electronic record of the payment order. If the beneficiary is not an established member, we will verify the identity of the person receiving the proceeds and obtain and retain a record of: The name and address. The type of identification reviewed. The number of the identification document. A record of the person's taxpayer identification number, or if none, alien identification number or passport and county of issue. 4. If we have reason to believe that the person receiving the proceeds is not the beneficiary, then we will also record all of the information noted above for the beneficiary as well as for the person receiving the funds on his or her behalf. 5. If the proceeds are delivered other than in person, as the beneficiary's bank, we will retain a copy of the check or other instrument used to effect payment, or the information contained therein, as well as the name and address of the person to whom it was sent. 6. We will keep the required information in such a fashion that we will be able to retrieve it by using the name of the originator unless he or she is an established member in which case we will be able to retrieve it by using an account number. 7. _Exemptions from the Record-Keeping Rules:_ Funds transfers or transmittal orders are exempt from the record-keeping rules if the originator and beneficiary are one of the following: A domestic bank. A wholly-owned domestic subsidiary of a domestic broker or dealer in securities. United States (Federal), state or local government or government agency. A non-bank financial institution. 8. We also do not have to retain the information noted earlier for transfers or transmittal orders when the originator and the beneficiary are the same and when the originators' and beneficiaries' domestic banks are the same. 5. Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) 1. If any credit union employee becomes aware of or suspects criminal activity by credit union members, non-members of the Shared Branching Network or employees, he or she should promptly report the matter to the BSA & Fraud Department (via a Suspicious Incident Report (SIR)) who will promptly investigate the matter further to determine whether to file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR). The investigation will be based on a review of the facts, as submitted by the employee and a discussion with credit union officers in charge of the affected areas. 2. Any staff aware of the matter will keep the information confidential. Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR) are also confidential. Any person subpoenaed or otherwise requested to disclose a SAR or the information contained in a SAR, shall decline to produce the information. In addition, the credit union should not place the SAR in the personnel files of any directors, officers, or employees who might be party to the suspicious activity. 3. If the credit union determines it is necessary to report a suspected illegal activity to local law enforcement authorities, the BSA & Fraud Department will carefully review all known facts. SARs will only be filed when there is a reasonable basis for believing that a specific crime has occurred, is occurring, or may occur. The ultimate decision to file a SAR relies with the BSA Officer. 4. A known or suspected violation is defined as any matter for which there is a basis to believe that a violation of a federal criminal statute (including a pattern of criminal violations) has occurred or has been attempted, is occurring, or may occur. That there is a basis to believe that a financial institution was an actual or potential victim of the criminal violation or was used to facilitate the criminal violation. The credit union will file a SAR as follows: The credit union detects a known or suspected violation of federal criminal law and substantial basis to believe that one of its directors, officers, employees, agents, or other institution-affiliated parties committed or aided in the commission of the violation. When the credit union detects a known or suspected violation of federal criminal law, involving or aggregating $5,000 or more, the credit union has a substantial basis for identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects. If the credit union detects a known or suspected violation of federal criminal law, involving or aggregating $25,000 or more, and the credit union has no substantial basis for identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects; or At any time, the credit union detects transactions aggregating $5,000 or more that involve potential money laundering or violate the Bank Secrecy Act. Any transaction means a deposit, withdrawal, transfer between accounts, exchange of currency, loan, an extension of credit, or purchase or sale of any stock, bond, certificate of deposit, or other monetary instrument or investment security, or any other payment, transfer, or delivery by, though, or to a financial institution, by whatever means effected, conducted or attempted by, at or through the credit union and involving or aggregating $5,000 or more in funds or other assets, if the credit union knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that: The transaction involves funds derived from illegal activities or is intended or conducted in order to hide or disguise funds or assets derived from illegal activities (including, without limitation, the ownership, nature, source, location, or control of such funds or assets) as part of a plan to violate or evade any law or regulation or to avoid any transaction reporting requirement under Federal law; The transaction is designed to evade any regulations promulgated under the Bank Secrecy Act; which includes an attempt at structuring the transaction or; The transaction has no business or apparent lawful purpose or is not the sort in which the particular member would normally be expected to engage, and the institution knows of no reasonable explanation for the transaction after examining the available facts, including the background and possible purpose of the transaction. AmeriCU will have 30 calendar days to file the SAR from the date that is determined that the SAR is warranted. If no suspect was identified on the date of detection of an act triggering the filing, the credit union may delay filing a SAR for 30 calendar days after the identification of a suspect. In no case shall reporting be delayed more than 60 calendar days after the date of detecting a known or suspected violation. In situations involving violations requiring immediate attention, such as terrorist financing or ongoing money laundering schemes, the credit union shall immediately notify by telephone, or other expeditious means, the appropriate law enforcement agency in addition to filing a timely SAR. If a currency transaction exceeds $10,000 and is suspicious, the credit union will file both a CTR and a SAR. If a currency transaction equals or is below $10,000 but is suspicious, the credit union will file only a SAR. The credit union will electronically file CTRs/SARs according to regulatory guidelines set forth by FinCEN. All Suspicious Activity Report data will be reported to the Board of Directors or through the Supervisory Committee as soon as practical after filing. 5. In the case where repeated SAR filings are necessary due to continued suspicious activity of an individual or entity, the matter will be referred to the Bank Secrecy Committee to determine what further action should be taken. 6. Anti-Money Laundering Policy 1. _Definition:_ Money laundering is the criminal practice of filtering ill-gotten gains or \"dirty\" money through a maze or series of transactions, so the funds are \"cleaned\" to look like proceeds from legal activities. Money laundering does not have to involve cash at every stage of the laundering process. Any transaction conducted with a credit union might constitute money laundering. Although money laundering is a diverse and often complex process, it involves three independent steps that can occur simultaneously: Placement: The process of placing, through deposits or other means, unlawful cash proceeds into traditional financial institutions. Layering: The process of separating the proceeds of criminal activity from their origin through the use of layers of complex financial transactions, such as converting cash into traveler's checks, money orders, wire transfers, letters of credit, stocks, bonds, or purchasing valuable assets, such as art or jewelry. Integration: The process of using an apparently legitimate transaction to disguise illicit proceeds, allowing the laundered funds to be disbursed back to the criminal. Different types of financial transactions, such as sham loans or false import/export invoices, can be used. 2. _Potential Indicators of Money Laundering_ A few of the identifiable areas of vulnerability that Credit Unions and other depository institutions should be aware of include: Structured currency deposits to individual checking accounts, often well below the typical levels for structuring, with multiple daily deposits to multiple accounts at different Financial Centers on the same day. Consumer checking accounts that are used for a period of time and then become dormant. In some cases, the accounts may have become overdrawn, perhaps as a further means of avoiding detection. Personal checking accounts opened by foreign nationals who come to the credit union together. Multiple accounts opened on the same day or held by the same foreign nationals at various credit unions. Increases in the frequency or amounts of currency deposits made by United States business account holders who export to Columbia. Suspicious transactions that might be linked to a common scheme. It may also be helpful to develop a dialogue with other financial institution representatives in your area to share ideas and exchange information. 3. _Enhanced Due Diligence_ Prudent practices require that financial institutions know the normal and routine activities of their members to better serve their needs. Additionally, in the United States banking environment, the USA Patriot Act requires financial institutions to take reasonable steps to ensure knowledge of credit union members' normal and routine business activities. At our Credit Union, these facts present us with many challenges, as many of our members generally do not have a routine activity. This section of our Anti-Money Laundering Policy sets forth our Credit Union's practices to identify members when: Opening accounts (both deposits and loans) Opening non-deposit accounts such as safe deposit boxes Identifying members who wire money and/or purchase monetary instruments Identifying activities, which are suspicious. 4. Through the provisions of this policy, each employee should make an effort to get to know members that they interact with on a routine or a one-time basis. 5. _Opening Consumer Accounts_ Our Credit Union will obtain and maintain in the member's file the following information for all types of consumer accounts. Social Security Number or Alien Identification Number (from U.S. residents). Verification of acceptable identification (also done via out-of-wallet questions for online account opening). Verification of address of residence. Estimation of anticipated account activity and member's income source and profession. Consideration of the source of funds to open the account. Information obtained from a service bureau to determine whether a member has been reported for overdrawing accounts, potentially conducting check-kiting schemes, etc. Comparison of the member with the OFAC and other government lists as directed by our federal regulator and law enforcement. Third-party references, verification services and telephone, website, and reverse directories. Other account relationships. 6. _Opening Business/Organization Accounts_ Our Credit Union will obtain and maintain in a central member file the following information for all types of business/organization accounts. The Member Due Diligence Program is in addition to the Risk Rating required by the Member Identification Program. Taxpayer identification (ID) number and legal name of the business. Verification of Legal Status. Verification of identification for principals, their addresses, phone numbers, and taxpayer Ids. (Note that a credit union employee personally knowing the member is not verification of the ID.) Obtain and record information about the Beneficial Owners of legal entities. This includes identifying an individual with significant control of the legal entity (Control Person). Estimate of anticipated account activity. Source of funds to open an account. A description of the principal line of business and all types of business operations it engages in. Information from a service bureau to determine the company's previous checking account history. Comparison of the member with the OFAC and other government lists as directed by our federal regulator and law enforcement. Other Credit Union account relationships. 7. _On-Going Review of Current Members and Non-Members against Government Lists_ Our policy for complying with the rules of the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) is outlined in the OFAC policy. 8. _Due Diligence_ Due to the fact that most of our geographic footprint is in both HIDTA and HIFCA we have taken the approach to treat all personal members the same. This means that all members at the time of account opening are subject to all alerts/scenarios and not exempt from any monitoring. Business accounts when opened are subject to an account opening risk assessment form. This process includes identifying high risk business types and expected transactions types. All accounts are subject to our automated Rule Based Risk Rating system which takes into account type, locations, business type, transactions (including volumes), account tags and previous SAR filings. This system rates all accounts in the system based on true activity which is a more accurate way to understand risk. 9. _Monitoring for Suspicious Activity_ Management institutes procedures in each department that are designed to detect and prevent money laundering. Management will ensure that the following reports are monitored for suspicious activity and that employees with those duties receive adequate internal and external training on detecting money laundering and other illegal activity. Cash transactions are monitored through our alert-based anti-money laundering system, BAM. This system looks for various scenarios of suspicious cash transactions including spikes, structuring, and velocity. 10. _Wire Transactions_ Wire transactions are monitored through our alert-based anti-money laundering system, BAM. This system looks for various scenarios of suspicious wire activity including, but not limited to, spikes, elder members, new accounts, wires to areas of concern, and overset thresholds. 11. _ACH Transactions_ ACH Transactions are monitored through our alert-based anti-money laundering system, BAM. This system looks for various scenarios of suspicious ACH activity including, but not limited to, spikes, high volume of tax refund credits, over-set thresholds, velocity, and transactions involving areas of concern. 12. _Higher Risk Members_ Our alert-based anti-money laundering system, BAM, looks for certain transactions in order to identify higher-risk members including Money Service Businesses and Private ATM owners. 13. _Delinquent Loans_ Our Loan Workout and Recovery team is trained in red flags regarding delinquent loans and will refer any in which they find suspicious activity. 14. _Hold Notices for Regulation CC_ Management is directed to train operations or member service staff to notify a supervisor or officer when they hold an unusual check (i.e., in amount or in the location of the drawee institution) on a member's account for the first time. 15. _Section 314(a)_ Section 314(a) of the USA Patriot Act required Treasury to implement regulations to facilitate communications between banks and law enforcement authorities regarding suspected money launderers and terrorists. Final rules requiring banks to share this information with law enforcement became effective September 26, 2002. Upon receiving a FinCEN 314(a) email request, the credit union's software will search its records to determine whether the credit union maintains or has maintained accounts for or has engaged in transactions with any individual, entity, or organization listed in the most recent files. Each new watch-list must be reviewed against the Credit Union's records within two weeks of the receipt of the FinCEN 314(a) email request. If a match is found, the match must be reported to FinCEN. Unless the request states otherwise, the search of all subjects on the 314(a) request and response with any matches must be completed no later than (14) calendar days after receiving the request. The credit union will store the audit logs for each watch-list analysis. The information obtained from FinCEN's secure website is confidential and will be disposed of in accordance with the ACU-11-004 Security and Operations Manual. 16. _Section 314(b)_ Section 314(b) of the USA Patriot Act of 2001 required Treasury to issue regulations, which would re-open the communication lines between bankers. The Section 314(b) rules encourage (but do not require) financial Institutions located in the United States to share information in order to identify and report activities that may involve terrorist activities or money laundering. Section 314(b) also provides specific protection from civil liability. If our Credit Union intends to share information about known or suspected terrorist activities or money laundering with financial institutions registered with FinCEN, our Credit Union will register with FinCEN. The FinCEN registration is good for twelve months from the date it is filed and will be renewed prior to expiration if our Credit Union continues to share under Section 314(b). Information received under Section 314(b) will only be accessed by the employee (or employees) who are registered with FinCEN as our Credit Union's point (or points) of contact. Our Credit Union will apply procedures similar to those established for complying with Section 501 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (15 USC 6801) for the protection of its member's non-public personal information. Our Credit Union's Sharing practices are identified in Section 314(b) Information Sharing procedure. 17. _High-Risk Members_ High-Risk members are re-evaluated every three months via the Rule Bases Risk Rating (RBRR) system. These parameters are documented and go through a change management process. The purpose of risk rating members is to better tailor the monitoring process to members' accounts that pose an increased risk. Money Services Business (MSB) poses a greater risk due to the \"banking\" type of services they offer to their customers. Due to this increased risk, the monitoring and due diligence for these accounts is conducted at a higher level. AmeriCU will allow members to conduct MSB activity if this is their secondary business, and they are compliant with all applicable laws and regulations. The MSB procedures will include: Appropriate CIP procedures Obtain and document that the MSB is registered with FinCEN Obtain and document that the MSB is compliant with state and local licensing requirements Document the MSB agent status and what types of products and services they offer 7.

Accordingly, the Credit Union\u2019s Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) authorized the Credit Union to provide banking services to Cannabis-Related Business (\u201cCRBs\u201d) and Ancillary Businesses that operate in compliance with state law and consistent with the requirements set forth in the 2014 FinCEN Guidance \u201cBSA Expectations Regarding Cannabis-Related Businesses, the BSA, this Policy, and its related Cannabis Banking Procedures. Given the greater risk of illicit activities presented by these types of businesses, and in light of the guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and FinCEN, the Credit Union adopts this Policy to establish risk based BSA/AML and related compliance standards for providing banking services to its CRB and Tier I and II Members. It should be noted that this Policy and the Program are not applicable to Hemp, Hemp CBD nor Delta-8 businesses. CU is providing services to those industries, but under a separate policy. The goals of this Policy are to: 1. Assess the risks associated with banking of cannabis related industries as outlined in FIN-2014-G001 and Cole Memos, as defined herein; 2. Establish CIP, CDD and EDD requirements for the Program; 3. Provide for a system of tracking and reporting on activities that may violate state or federal law; and 4. Promote greater financial transparency in this industry through the banking of these Members. Specialty Banking Account Locations and Types The Credit Union will provide services to CRB, and Tier I and Tier II members located primarily in the state of New York but will support CRB Accounts in other states, as long as the primary account of the CRB is held with the Credit Union. Other North American locations, such as Canada, will be considered on an exception basis. For information on Tier III Member products and services, see CU\u2019s standard ACU-11-006 Bank Secrecy Act/AML/OFAC Compliance Policy. The Credit Union offers the following Accounts to CRB and Tier I Members: Select Business Freedom Checking Account The Credit Union offers the following Accounts to Tier II Members: The Credit Union\u2019s standard commercial accounts and suite of services. (Note, accounts will have a dedicated account code for this account type) The Credit Union is providing banking services to the owners and employees of CRB businesses of the Credit Union, and that these members will not be classified through the CRB tiering process set forth herein. See the Credit Union\u2019s standard ACU-11-006 Bank Secrecy Act/AML Compliance Policy for details. As part of this Policy, all CRBs, Tier Is and IIs are required to undergo heightened due diligence assessments and ongoing monitoring to assure the Credit Union that these accounts are not involved in any activity that appears to violate any law or regulation applicable to the license of record, including state law, and federal regulatory guidance including the Cole Memos, FIN-2014- 0001, and any future state or federal guidance related to CRBs. This Policy is structured to provide an overview of the applicable laws, regulations, ordinances, and guidance applicable for a CRB along with specific internal Cannabis Banking Procedures designed to comply with the foregoing. The requirements set forth in this Policy and the corresponding Cannabis Banking Procedures are in addition to any other requirements or procedures set forth under the Credit Union\u2019s ACU-11-006 Bank Secrecy Act/AML Compliance Policy. This Policy incorporates the provisions of the Credit Union\u2019s BSA/AML policy and procedures as if fully set forth herein.

Bank Secrecy Act Committee (BSAC) Chief Risk Officer Chief Financial Officer Chief Operating Officer BSA Officer/AVP, Specialty Banking & Fraud Prevention And Additional AmeriCU staff as determined... Background and Guidance 1. Controlled Substances Act (CSA) 1. Pursuant to the CSA, cannabis is classified as a Schedule I substance. By definition, Schedule I drugs have a high potential for abuse and dependency, with no recognized medical use or value. Any cannabis possession, cultivation, or use is a federal crime, subjecting a defendant to fines, prison time, or both. Large scale cultivation and trafficking (transporting or selling cannabis, often across state lines) incurs harsher penalties, and tends to be the main focus of federal drug enforcement attention. 2. In spite of this federal ban, 37 states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws that allow or protect the medicinal and/or recreational use of cannabis. Most of these states have decriminalized medicinal and/or recreational cannabis use for those who follow state and local law with respect to their regulated cannabis system. State-level penalties still apply to those who break these state laws and cannabis still remains illegal at the federal level. 2. New York State Laws 1. New York \u2013 Cannabis Market History 1. In March 2021, New York passed SB 854-A, the Marihuana Regulation and Taxation Act. The bill legalized purchasing, possessing, and transporting up to 3 ounces (85 grams) of weed and up to 24 grams of concentrate for adults 21 and older. 2. The bill also set up licensing guidelines for growers, producers, distributors, and retailers while attempting to address long-standing issues around race, social equity, and enforcement of cannabis laws. Automatic expungement or resentencing was included for those convicted of acts no longer considered illegal. 3. In 2019, lawmakers expanded a 1977 law that decriminalized cannabis. Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed the decriminalization bill into law on July 29, 2019, and it went into effect a month later. 4. Medical cannabis was legalized in 2014 under New York's Compassionate Care Act, or S7923, which permitted the possession, use, manufacture, delivery, transport, and administration of medical cannabis by patients and designated caregivers. 5. On March 31, 2021, the Cannabis Regulation and Taxation Act (MRTA) legalized cannabis for adults 21 years of age or older. This law sets out a framework that will comprehensively regulate cannabis in New York State in a manner that will protect public health and safety, while promoting social equity and economic development. Rules and regulations for recreational cannabis are being promulgated by the state. Timelines for roll-out have been varied, but the goal is sometime in 2022. 2. Regulatory Oversight 1. Under Bill SB 854-A, The Office of Cannabis Management shall oversee all cannabis-related matters including medical, recreational, and hemp. 3. Cannabis Banking Services and License Types 1. AmeriCU will offer banking services to the following CRB license types: 1. Medical : 1. Cannabis Medical Dispensaries 2. Cannabis Cultivations 3. Cannabis Processors 2. Adult-Use/Recreational : 1. Cannabis Retail Dispensaries 2. Cannabis Cultivations 3. Cannabis Processors 1. These licenses are issued conditionally until NYS allows for permanent licensor applications. 2. At this time, AmeriCU will not offer banking services to the following New York CRB license types: 1. Cannabis Trust Companies 2. Cannabis Caregivers 3. AmeriCU will offer banking services to Cannabis Non-profits on an exception basis only. 3. Federal Guidance 1. DOJ has issued the Cole Memos outlining its enforcement priorities related to various federal laws in light of state legalized cannabis activity. Although the Cole Memos were formally rescinded in 2018 by former Attorney General Sessions, the priorities identified in the Cole Memos still form the framework for how FinCEN and other federal and state regulatory agencies currently review financial institutions that provide services to CRBs. 2. On February 14, 2014, in coordination with DOJ, FinCEN released the FinCEN Guidance to financial institutions seeking to provide banking services to CRBs. This FinCEN Guidance, which incorporates by reference the Cole Memos, is still in effect. 3. As of the creation of this Policy, Merrick B. Garland is the United States Attorney General. Garland has yet to make his views on cannabis explicitly clear, although his judicial record indicates deference to the Drug Enforcement Agency\u2019s guidance on such matters. 4. This FinCEN Guidance clarifies how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their BSA obligations. In general, the decision to open, close, or refuse any particular account or relationship should be made by each financial institution based on a number of factors specific to that institution. These factors may include its particular business objectives, an evaluation of the risks associated with offering a particular product or service, and its capacity to manage those risks effectively. Thorough member due diligence is a critical aspect of making this assessment. 5. FinCEN\u2019s Guidance reaffirms existing federal regulations, sets forth specific obligations of financial institutions that incorporate all of the above, and revises certain reporting requirements. 6. Through the Cole Memos, DOJ has set forth certain enforcement priorities, related to state cannabis activity, referenced by, and incorporated into the FinCEN Guidance. These enforcement priorities are as follows: 1. Preventing the distribution of cannabis to minors; 2. Preventing revenue from the sale of cannabis from going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels; 3. Preventing the diversion of cannabis from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states; 4. Preventing state-authorized cannabis activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; 5. Preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis; 6. Preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with cannabis use; 7. Preventing the growing of cannabis on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by cannabis production on public lands; and 8. Preventing cannabis possession or use on federal property. Identification and mitigation of risks associated with cannabis-related businesses. 7. The clarified standards and filing responsibilities contained within the FinCEN Guidance include: 1. Identification and mitigation of risks associated with cannabis-related businesses 2. Enhanced pre-opening due diligence (CIP, CDD, EDD) for cannabis-related businesses 3. Ongoing monitoring for compliance with the FinCEN Guidance and Cole Memos 4. Ongoing monitoring for compliance under state and local law 5. Reporting requirements 1. Filing of Cannabis Limited SARs (see below) 2. Filing of Cannabis Priority SARs (see below) 3. Filing of Cannabis Termination SARs (see below) 4. Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) 8. The obligation to file a SAR is unaffected by any state law that legalizes cannabis-related activity. A financial institution is required to file a SAR if, consistent with FinCEN regulations, the financial institution knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that a transaction conducted or attempted by, at, or through the financial institution: (i) involves funds derived from illegal activity or is an attempt to disguise funds derived from illegal activity; (ii) is designed to evade regulations promulgated under the BSA, or (iii) lacks a business or apparent lawful purpose. Because federal law prohibits the distribution and sale of cannabis, financial transactions involving a cannabis related business would generally involve funds derived from illegal activity. Therefore, a financial institution is required to file a SAR on activity involving a cannabis-related business (including those duly licensed under state law), in accordance with the FinCEN Guidance and FinCEN\u2019s suspicious activity reporting requirements and related thresholds. 9. The FinCEN Guidance also imposes special requirements on the Credit Union for filing the following three types on SARs on cannabis-related accounts: 1. . \u201cMarijuana Limited\u201d SAR. The Credit Union shall file a \u201cMarijuana Limited\u201d SAR when it provides financial services to a CRB that it reasonably believes, based on its current member due diligence, does not implicate one of the Cole Memos priorities or violate state law. The content of the Marijuana Limited SAR shall include only the following information: (i) identifying information of the subject and related parties, (ii) addresses of the subject and related parties, (iii) the fact that the Credit Union is filing the SAR solely because the subject is engaged in a cannabis-related business, and (iv) the fact that no additional suspicious activity has been identified. Credit Union personnel preparing the Marijuana Limited SAR shall include the term \u201cMARIJUANA LIMITED\u201d in the narrative section. Furthermore, the Credit Union shall follow FinCEN\u2019s existing guidelines on the timing of filing activity reports for the same activity initially reported in the Marijuana Limited SAR. The continuing activity report may contain the same limited content as the initial SAR plus details about the amount of deposits, withdrawals, and transfers in the account since the last SAR. However, if, in the course of conducting member due diligence (including ongoing red flag monitoring), the financial institution detects changes in activity that potentially implicate one of the Cole Memos priorities or violate state law, the financial institution should file a \u201cMarijuana Priority\u201d SAR. 2. \u201cMarijuana Priority\" SAR. The Credit Union shall file a \u201cMarijuana Priority\u201d SAR on a CRB or CRB Account if it reasonably believes, based on its member due diligence, implicates one of the Cole Memos priorities or violates state law. The content of the Marijuana Priority SAR shall include comprehensive detail in accordance with existing regulations and guidance. Details particularly relevant to law enforcement in this context include: (i) identifying information of the subject and related parties, (ii) addresses of the subject and related parties, (iii) details regarding the enforcement priorities the Credit Union believes have been implicated, (iv) and dates, amounts, and other relevant details of financial transactions involved in the suspicious activity. Credit Union personnel filing any Marijuana Priority SAR shall include the term \u201cMARIJUANA PRIORITY\u201d in the narrative section to help law enforcement distinguish these SARs. 3. \u201cMarijuana Termination\" SAR. If the CRB relationship is terminated with the Credit Union, in order to maintain an effective AML compliance program, Credit Union personnel shall file a \" Marijuana Termination\" SAR and note in the narrative the basis for termination. Additionally, the Credit Union will file this type of SAR in cases where the member decides to terminate the relationship with the Credit Union. Credit Union personnel shall use the term \u201cMARIJUANA TERMINATION\u201d in the narrative section in either scenario. 10. In addition to the above, the FinCEN Guidance lists a number of \u201cred flags\u201d that should be incorporated into the ongoing monitoring process as a basis for SAR filings. These red flags indicate that a CRB or CRB Account may be engaged in activity that implicates one of the Cole Memos priorities or violates state law, and that additional due diligence should be conducted related to such activity. Credit Union personnel should consult the FinCEN Guidance, when determining whether to file a SAR for a CRB Member. The red flags are summarized as follows: 1. The business appears to be using a state licensed CRB as a front or pretext to launder money derived from other unrelated or criminal activity. 2. The business is unable to produce satisfactory documentation or evidence to demonstrate that it is duly licensed and operating consistently within State law. 3. The business is unable to demonstrate the legitimate source of significant outside investments. 4. A member seeks to conceal or disguise involvement in a cannabis-related activity through the use of a non-descript business name. 5. A review of publicly available sources and databases about the business, its owners, managers, or related parties reveals negative information, such as a criminal record, illegal activity involving drugs, violence or connections to illicit activities. 6. The business or any of its principals have been subjected to an enforcement action by State or local authorities responsible for administering or enforcing cannabis-related laws or regulations. (if applicable under state statues) 7. A CRB engages in international or interstate activity or conducts significant business with persons or entities located in different states or countries. (if applicable under state statues) 8. The owner of the CRB resides outside the state in which the CRB operates. (if applicable under state statues) 9. The CRB is located on Federal property or obtains cannabis that was grown on Federal property. 10. The CRB proximity to a school or daycare facility is in violation of State law. 11. A CRB purports to be a \u201cnon-profit\u201d or tax-exempt entity but is engaged in activities inconsistent with its classification or is making excessive payments to related parties. Compliance Policies 1. State and Local Regulations and Ordinances 1. The Credit Union\u2019s policy is to confirm that its CRB, Tier I and Tier II members have obtained all required state licenses, including those applicable to cannabis-related activities, as well as standard business licenses. In this regard, state and local laws and ordinances exist for a CRB to the same extent as for a business in general. These include state/local municipality issued business licenses, state sales tax licenses, sales tax payment invoices, etc. Accordingly, an assessment for compliance on a CRB should include verification that the CRB is conducting its business in a legal and reasonable manner. This is accomplished by establishing a baseline onsite compliance audit conducted in-house or by the Credit Union\u2019s approved third-party vendors. Subsequent audits will be required at least annually on the CRB business, or more frequently as determined by the BSAC. 2. Customer Identification 1. The Credit Union will follow its standard member identification policy for performing Customer Identification Program (CIP) on CRB and Tier I and Tier II applicants. The Credit Union WILL NOT conduct any transaction with a person or CRB whose identity cannot be verified in accordance with this Policy, the applicable Cannabis Banking Procedures, and CIP processes. 3. CIP Initial Member Due Diligence for Cannabis Specialty Banking Accounts 1. The initial CDD for a CRB, Tier I and Tier II Account will be completed by obtaining the standard documents required for any business account per the Credit Union\u2019s standard procedures, as well as those outlined in any applicable Account policy or procedure. 4. Enhanced Due Diligence for Cannabis Specialty Banking Accounts 1. A robust risk-based CIP and EDD for CRB and Tier I and Tier II Accounts is especially critical in understanding their anticipated transactions and implementing a suspicious activity monitoring system that reduces the Credit Union\u2019s reputation, compliance, and transaction risks. CRB, Tier I, and Tier II Accounts and their transactions are reviewed more closely at account opening and more frequently throughout the term of their relationship with the Credit Union. 2. The Credit Union generally determines that a member poses a higher risk, and is therefore subject to EDD, because of the member\u2019s business activity, ownership structure, anticipated or actual volume, and types of transactions, including those transactions conducted in higher-risk jurisdictions. 3. In the case of CRB, Tier I, and Tier II members, the Credit Union will complete specialized risk scoring tailored to these accounts and performs EDD on each such member. 4. The Credit Union obtains or will obtain (as applicable, depending on classification of member), both at account opening and throughout the relationship, the following information on the member: 1. Purpose of the account. 2. Source of funds. 3. Individuals with ownership or control over the account, such as beneficial owners, signatories, or guarantors. 4. All other business organizations affiliated or under common control with the member, including a complete organizational chart that identifies any such entities that are a CRB, Tier I, or Tier II. 5. Occupation or type of business (of member or other individuals with ownership or control over the account). 6. Financial statements and tax returns (federal, state, and sales tax). 7. Domicile (where the business is organized). 8. Description of the member\u2019s primary trade area. 9. Description of the business operations, the anticipated volume of currency and total sales, and a list of key vendors/suppliers. 10. Explanations for changes in account activity. 11. Licensure with the State and Jurisdiction (if applicable). 12. Certification of Good Standing with the State and Jurisdiction (if applicable). 13. Onsite Audit of the CRB\u2019s operations. 14. Payors and Payees with whom the CRB does business. 15. And as needed, a Business Organizational Chart (for entity applying for the account). 5. Enhanced due diligence is an ongoing process and, as such, the Credit Union will take measures to ensure account profiles are current and monitoring should be risk-based. As mentioned previously, a risk score will be prepared discussing salient information on the member. The recommendation will be prepared by the Credit Union\u2019s Specialty Banking Team and provided to the BSAC for final review. The BSAC may deny any Account from opening or decide to close an Account in its sole discretion. 5. Risk Assessment 1. The Credit Union performed an initial analysis of risk associated with the Program and performed a risk assessment to identify and measure AML and related risks associated with providing banking services to CRBs. This risk assessment will be reviewed and updated on a regular basis but no less than on an annual basis by the BSA Officer. 6. Account Limitations 1. As a general matter, the Credit Union permits an individual company (based on licensure or entity with a single employee identification number or \u201cEIN\u201d) to open more than one account. For example, an Account member/Accountholder may operate dispensaries at multiple locations. 2. The Credit Union will not permit multiple companies (or entities with multiple EINs) to operate through a single account until the source of funds has been determined. A further distinguishing measure might also include accounts by location, which is a discretionary determination made by the BSAC. These limitations are intended to ensure that undisclosed entities are not able to launder money through Accounts that Account members and Accountholders are not able to disguise the volume of their activities by spreading them among multiple accounts. If the Credit Union detects those undisclosed entities are conducting transactions through an Account of an Accountholder, without the Credit Union determining the source of funds, the Account will immediately be referred to the BSAC for possible termination and SAR reporting pursuant to the Credit Union\u2019s procedures. 7. Concentration, Aggregate Deposit and Lending Limits 1. The Credit Union will limit the total number of state licensed CRB and Tier I members to 15% of its total deposits, calculated quarterly. Going forward, the Credit Union will aggregate average balances from CRB/Tier I Accounts (this metric does not include Tier II deposits) to 15% or less of the total deposits of the Credit Union and will review this metric quarterly. This ratio will be monitored monthly, but no changes to the Program will happen until the quarterly numbers are reviewed. The CFO will report these numbers to the Board on a monthly basis. The Board may adjust the ratio following such reports, and the Credit Union will not exceed a 2% variance of this quarterly ratio without approval by the Board. 2. In addition to its Specialty Banking depository services, AmeriCU is lending to CRBs, Tier 1, and Tier II Ancillary Businesses. For more details, please see the Specialty Banking Commercial Lending Policy Addendum and Procedure documents, respectively. Standard commercial lending policies and procedures apply to Tier III member loans and will be underwritten based on risk. 8. Withdrawals 1. Additional details for each of these controls are in the Cannabis Account Procedures. With respect to withdrawals and lending, the Credit Union will implement the following controls: 1. _Withdrawals_ CRBs may make withdrawals (change orders) through authorized cash transport service. Tier I and Tier II members may make withdrawals through authorized cash transport service or through an in-person withdrawal at the branch. POS withdrawals for CRBs are prohibited. Any exceptions to this policy must be approved by the Credit Union. 2. _Use of Debit Cards/Credit Cards_ Under the current program perimeters, debit cards will be issued to CRB members. No CRBs members are allowed to hold a credit card. Tier I and Tier II members are allowed to hold a debit card and/or credit card. 9. Currency Transaction Reports and Cash Deposits 1. In general, the Credit Union will follow its existing policies and procedures in preparing and submitting CTRs in Abrigo in connection with cash deposited by CRB and Tier I members. However, in accordance with the FinCEN Guidance, the Credit Union will not treat any currency transaction with an CRB or Tier I Member as a transaction with an exempt person. Furthermore, no CRB Member is allowed to utilize the Shared Branching Network as part of their account services. 2. CRBs are only allowed to deposit cash via an approved third-party cash transporter. Tier I and Tier II members are permitted to make cash deposits via the branch, approved branch night drop or by approved cash transport service(s). These members may make deposits at the Credit Union branch, as long as this activity does not interfere with the daily operations at the branch. If for any reason the Credit Union determines this activity to be disruptive to operations, the Credit Union reserves the right to rescind branch banking and require cash transport services for the member. 3. For all CRB Accounts subject to this Policy, each cash deposit must be accompanied by complete transaction records to support the amount of the deposit. The Credit Union will not accept for deposit any funds that cannot be reconciled against the POS System and cross-referenced by the state\u2019s Seed-to-Sale tracking system if the POS System denotes a variance. Deposits made are subject to this validation and will be considered \u201cprovisional\u201d until funds can vetted. The Credit Union reserves the right to reject and return any attempted deposit by a member of the Credit Union if unable to validate that the deposit amounts resulted from legal sales of cannabis or sales of non-cannabis products. 4. Additionally, no cannabis products are allowed on Credit Union premises in any capacity, including but not limited to: commingled in deposits; on their person; as a gift for staff, etc. Violations of this policy may include immediate termination of their account. 5. For purpose of this Policy, the term legacy cash refers to currency possessed by a CRB member prior to opening an account(s) with the Credit Union that was (1) legally earned by a CRB under a state license or otherwise in compliance with state law, and (2) never deposited in a financial institution. The Credit Union will not accept any cash that was earned by a CRB engaged in cannabis-related activities prior to having a state license or that is otherwise determined to have been obtained in violation of state law. 6. With respect to deposits by CRB\u2019s, the Credit Union will only accept the following: 1. physical cash or electronic transfers of funds that are demonstrated through financial records or other documentation as having been generated from a legal, non-CRB source; 2. physical cash or electronic transfers of funds that are demonstrated through financial records or other documentation as having been generated in compliance with CRB activity by a State-licensed entity; an attestation or audit by a licensed, reputable CPA that is and in Good Standing in the state. 3. electronic transfers of funds from CRB activity licensed in states other than New York that can be validated. Validation can be demonstrated through financial records or other documentation as having been generated in compliance with local rules and regulations for that licensure. The Credit Union will accept physical cash deposits from CRBs that are operating in states other than New York as long as the revenue can be validated via the POS System and if needed, the State\u2019s approved Seed-to-Sale Tracking System. These deposits will be collected by an authorized third-party cash transporter. 4. As described in the Cannabis Banking Procedures, the Credit Union may require CRBs to provide a third-party audit of all legacy cash (defined above) funds to be deposited prior to accepting any such deposit unless the deposit is coming from a financial institution that is known for operating a cannabis banking program and their program is regulated by a State and/or Federal regulator. 5. CTRs are required for transactions involving most corporations or other publicly traded entities (such as partnerships). Unlike the standard BSA Policy, any Specialty Banking-related account will have a CTR filed based on account activity. 10. ACH and Wire Transactions 1. CRBs and Tier I members may send and receive ACH and wire payments, subject to the following limitations, as further described in the Cannabis Specialty Banking Procedures. 2. CRB and Tier I members may send and receive such payments once their account at the Credit Union has been established. In general, CRB and Tier I members can send ACH or wire payments to out-of-state payees as long as the payee has been validated against the OFAC Watchlist. 3. For Tier II members, the Credit Union may review out-of-state payees as part of the regular transaction review process to determine if there is risk that the Tier II member is sending cannabis proceeds to a state where such transactions are illegal. Any attempt to send payments out-of-state not in compliance with this Policy will be reviewed by the BSA Officer and repeated such attempts should be evaluated to determine if Account termination is appropriate. 11. Individual Accounts for Owners, Principals and Employees of CRBs 1. The Credit Union provides banking services to the owners and employees of CRBs, Tier I and Tier II businesses, and that these individual members will not be classified through the Program set forth herein. In providing banking services to individuals associated with an CRB or Tier I or Tier II member, the Credit Union will perform the following due diligence on such individuals: OFAC Check ChexSystems Beneficial Owner Certification (if applicable) Background Checks (if applicable) Compliance Software 1. Cannabis account onboarding and ongoing account monitoring will be carried out using the Shield Compliance software application and through additional, periodic reviews, as set forth in the Cannabis Banking Procedures. 2. This application establishes profiles for the expected POS System and Seed-to-Sale Tracking transaction types/amounts and compares actual activity against the profile amounts in order to isolate variances which may indicate a need for a Cannabis Limited, Cannabis Priority or Cannabis Termination SAR. Deposits are reviewed and monitored prior to deposit in the Credit Union in an effort to prevent illicit funds from entering into Accounts. As part of the Program, the Credit Union will mandate that the CRB businesses deposit 90% of their validated revenue into their CU Account. Variances of 3% +/- will be researched and documented for compliance with program perimeters and SAR filings. 3. In addition to cannabis compliance software, the Credit Union has implemented Abrigo as their overall portfolio Compliance and Fraud-Monitoring Software. 4. Abrigo provides: 1. Complete Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering Compliance \u2013 Detection of Human Trafficking, Funnel Accounts, Terrorist Financing, International Activity and Movement of Funds; provides automated SAR reporting, as well as automated BSA record keeping. 2. Proactive Fraud Detection \u2013 Detects fraudulent activity occurring across multiple channels (including online/mobile account, wire/ACH, check, and card fraud) to greatly reduce potential loss. 3. Watch List & 314(a) Checking \u2013 Automatically scans people, vendors, and businesses against the OFAC SDN list, performs 314(a) searches, checks incoming and outgoing wires to flag positive matches, and allows for the creation of internal scan lists. 5. Through Core or Manual Processes, AmeriCU reviews: 1. CTRs 2. 314(b) Collaboration & Information Sharing \u2013 Facilitates collaboration between 314(b)- registered institutions. 3. End-to-End Customer Due Diligence & Enhanced Due Diligence \u2013 Provides a CDD/EDD solution, including account opening CDD Questionnaire and validation of Beneficial Owners through a Beneficial Owner Certification. 6. Periodic Monitoring and Reporting Activities As set forth in more detail in the Cannabis Banking Procedures, the Credit Union will perform periodic transaction monitoring and reviews of CRB and Ancillary Business Accounts. Oversight of the Program includes regular reporting to the BSAC, as well as the Board. Metrics reviewed for suspicious activity include, but not limited to: 1. If account activity appears unusual, the CU team member should notify the BSA Officer for further investigation. Any transactions inconsistent with the member\u2019s normal business activities should be reported to the BSA department. 2. Quality and assurance checks of deposits, reconciled to POS reports. 3. Currency activity generated by the business. 4. Currency activity, including transaction limits. 5. Currency activity (single and multiple transactions) below the $10,000 reporting requirement (e.g., between $3,000 and $10,000) (Completed via Abrigo). 6. Sale of Cashier\u2019s Checks. 7. Domestic and International Wire Transfers 8. Subpoena Activity - Any subpoenas received by the Credit Union are input into the CRB Account files with key risk-based identification, including date received, issuing authority, response date and a commentary field. The receipt of a subpoena from a Family Court may indicate a divorce proceeding, which is not unusual. But a subpoena received from the DEA, or the State indicates a significant threat of possible criminal activity. A copy of subpoenas that are received are to be retained in the Credit Union\u2019s records by the Deposit Operations Department and reviewed by the BSA Officer. All subpoenas received on a CRB, or Tier I or Tier II member will be reviewed and considered by the Credit Union for purposes of updating the Credit Union\u2019s evaluation and risk assessment of the member. 9. Monitoring of Specialty Banking Accounts \u2013 all CRBs, Tier I, Tier II businesses; owners, and authorized signers will be monitored on the internet for any articles, negative or positive, written or posted about the business or individuals associated with the Accounts via Shield Compliance. These articles will be brought to the attention of the BSA Officer for further evaluation and maintained as part of the Account due diligence. 7. Reconciliation 1. CRB\u2019s Specialty Banking Account deposits are reconciled to the CRB\u2019s POS accounting reports through Shield Compliance and if there is a variance, the Credit Union may also review the Seed-to-Sale tracking data. If the totals do not match and are not within the determined variance threshold, the account is reviewed. Customer documentation reflecting data on variances and/or flagged transactions is required. The Specialty Banking Team reviews all Shield Compliance reconciliation reports. 8. Ongoing Monitoring and Activities 1. The Program\u2019s ongoing monitoring is designed to test actual financial activity against an expected activity level that is determined on a member-by-member basis prior to opening of the account. This \u201cmember profile\u201d is established for an aggregate of specific types of transactions. 2. The profile amounts are established as levels that are expected for the specific Account, as initially set forth on the Shield Application. These profile levels may be modified on a member-by-member basis following detailed reviews of actual activity that is determined to be normal and expected for this Account. 3. The monitoring function is established using data that is tabulated on a daily or monthly basis depending on the transaction type. 4. The standard activity set consists of: 1. Amount of Total Deposits 2. Amount of Currency Deposits 3. Amount of Currency Withdrawals 5. If the activity by an Account exceeds one or more of these profile thresholds, the Account is reviewed, which requires that the Credit Union investigate the exception activity and make a determination that the exception activity is both explainable and appropriate or the activity suggests further detailed investigation up to and including the filing of a Cannabis Related SAR (Limited, Priority & Termination). Note, Tier II Accounts will follow the Credit Union\u2019s standard BSA Policy and Procedures, including SAR filings. 9. Financial Data 1. The Credit Union completes an initial review of the financials of the CRB Account/Tier I Account at account opening to determine ACH and wire limits, and thereafter on at least an annual basis according to the schedule for reviewing the member\u2019s account to ensure these limits are accurate. The frequency of this review will be based on their risk score. The review may take into consideration the following: 1. Review of continued state licensing, including without limit, any correspondence and/or violations issued by applicable regulatory agencies 2. Review of continued state licensing including without limit any correspondence and/or violations issued by applicable regulatory agencies 3. Review of state tax payment invoices, correlated to financial statements 4. Review of financial statements with focus on top line revenue, expenses, and net profit/loss 5. Audits conducted by a qualified company or in-house to ensure compliance with existing state and municipality cannabis regulations 2. Significant differences are investigated, reconciled and/or reported as required by the FinCEN Guidance for cannabis-related SARs. Oversight of the Program includes regular reporting to the BSA Officer, as well as the Board. 10. Inventory Monitoring 1. When New York State implements the Seed-to-Sale software, the Credit Union will adhere to the following. The Credit Union receives Seed-to-Sale tracking data, but in the state of New York, this software does not capture all transactions, nor is it applicable to all licensure types. Therefore, the Credit Union will review this data to reconcile differences of 3% +/- as noted in the member\u2019s accounting records vs the deposits made by the CRB member. With the deposit threshold of 90% for CRB members, this number when compared to the accounting records can detect anomalies that require additional research. In addition, the Credit Union will require an onsite audit of the CRB at least annually to be conducted in-house or by an approved third-party onsite auditing company. 11. Filing Suspicious Activity Reports on CRB Accounts 1. In addition to the monitoring function that will begin immediately upon the commencement of business by the CRB Account, the Credit Union will file a Marijuana Limited SAR within thirty (30) days of account opening. 2. The Credit Union will file an additional Marijuana Limited SAR every ninety (90) days thereafter which will contain a summary of banking activity, with the filing deadline being one hundred and twenty (120) days after the date of the previously related SAR filing. 3. The Credit Union will submit a Marijuana Priority SAR if it reasonably believes that a member is engaged in some form of illegal or suspicious activity, or activity that implicates one of the Cole Memos priorities or violates state law. Depending on the circumstances, the Account will be terminated or placed on a special watch list for 90-days and if a subsequent violation occurs a Marijuana Termination SAR will be filed, and the Account will be closed. 12. Third-Party Auditor 1. Going forward, the Credit Union will conduct a third-party audit of the Program, which will include independent testing and auditing of the Credit Union\u2019s BSA/AML compliance program and CIP, as part of the annual internal review plan and will report its findings to the Board. Each audit will examine all applicable reporting, recordkeeping, registrations, and program requirements of the Cannabis Banking Program and the Cannabis Banking Procedures. The findings of each audit will be summarized in a written report and accompanied by the auditor\u2019s suggestions for corrective actions, if necessary. This audit will be performed at least every 12-months (rolling calendar). 13. Board Reporting 1. The Chief Risk Officer and/or the BSA Officer shall provide the Board with a report detailing BSA/AML compliance/operations at the Credit Union. The report shall include, but may not be limited to, information and trends necessary to keep the Board apprised of the Credit Union\u2019s Cannabis Account activity. Refer to the Cannabis Banking Procedures for details on the reporting requirements. Exit Strategy 1. In the event CU determines it necessary to exit and close all Accounts, the Credit Union will follow the procedures outlined below: 1. The BSAC will review the current program metrics to determine whether or not the Credit Union will need to utilize any of its liquidity sources to shore-up the Credit Union\u2019s Balance Sheet prior to announcing the Credit Union\u2019s exit. 2. Once the BSAC has determined the Credit Union is ready to move forward, the Credit Union notifies all affected deposit members of its intent to close the accounts within a predetermined timeframe set by the Credit Union. 1. The Credit Union will notify all affected members of its intent to close the accounts within predetermined time frame. Depending on the number of accounts at the time of exit, this time frame could be shortened/lengthened. 2. During the specified time frame, affected members will be allowed to make deposits and transact on their accounts as normal, provided the affected member remains in compliance with the deposit account agreement. 3. The Credit Union will continue to monitor the Account in accordance with its policies and procedures. 4. At account closing, the Credit Union issues a payment, for any remaining balance in the account, less any fees or pending items. 5. The BSA Officer will file a Cannabis Termination SAR for each entity at account closing following normal Credit Union procedures. 6. The Credit Union will retain all account related documentation as required under the BSA regulations. 7. Any updates to the Credit Union\u2019s liquidity are performed during the quarterly review process and the Credit Union makes changes to the Program accordingly. In the event of Account Program closure, the CFO will adjust borrowings to shore-up any liquidity differences. Identification of Undisclosed CRBs in Credit Union\u2019s Portfolios 1. The Credit Union implemented the following methods and procedures to identify undisclosed CRBs in the Credit Union\u2019s portfolio\u2014businesses of a type that should be subject to this Policy whose accounts are operating as standard business accounts. When a previously undisclosed CRB member is identified, if the Credit Union decides to maintain the member relationship, the Credit Union will subject such member to this Policy and the Cannabis Banking Procedures as if they were a new member, taking into account the member\u2019s previous lack of disclosure and filing any required SARs. Inclusion of cannabis-related questions in the standard account application process, as well as staff asking questions at account opening, to determine if the member is engaged in any cannabis activities or receives any cannabis related revenue. Customers that answer in the affirmative will be subject to this Policy and the Cannabis Banking Procedures. Continuous suspicious activity monitoring to detect possible cannabis-related activity, including transactions indicative of cannabis members. Credit Union personnel are trained on an annual basis to detect and report abnormal activity. Abrigo review of the portfolio to monitor this type of activity monthly. Enhanced Cannabis Training 1. Credit Union employees with responsibilities related to cannabis members and the Accounts will be required to attend training on cannabis-specific issues at least annually. Such training will include: An overview of the federal guidance relating to banking CRBs; An overview of the cannabis industry as legalized in New York, and other states where CU members have locations that are banking with CU; and Review and training on this Cannabis Policy and the Cannabis Banking Procedures. 2. To the extent possible, the cannabis training will include presentations from law enforcement on cannabis-related topics. Each employee with responsibility for a cannabis-related process must attend cannabis training at least annually.

Actions that can be imposed on a member or non-member are broken into two categories: Restriction of Services and Barring and/or Expulsion. These two distinct actions are outlined below: Restriction of Services : This action will be used for members that have or attempted to cause a loss to the Credit Union. A Manager can make this determination and restrict services as needed. Examples of these restrictions follow: Denial of all or some services other than the right to maintain a share account and the right to vote at annual and special meetings. Restriction of services includes but is not limited to: Online/Mobile Banking ITM Mobile Deposit Debit Card Bill Pay P2P This list is not exhaustive and is used only as an example of types of services that may be restricted. Barring and Expulsion Barring is an action that will be used for members or non-members who exhibit behaviors that are abusive as defined in this Policy, but who have not presented an reasonable inference of danger to person or property. A person may be barred from the premises and have services restricted if it is determined that the person has engaged in abusive behavior. Examples of the barring follow: Prohibition from personal contact with Credit Union employees or volunteers such that Credit Union services may be available only through written communication through the U.S. mail or remote access. Prohibition from access to Credit Union premises. Ultimate barring decision will be approved by the AVP, Specialty Banking and Fraud Prevention. Expulsion is an action that will be used for members who either repeatedly exhibit behaviors that are abusive as defined in this Policy, or who have may be reasonably inferred as posing an immediate danger to persons or property. Expulsion consists of all the actions listed constituted Barring of a member, and also includes closing all of the member's shares, including the member's prime share. BSAC can recommended the expulsion of a member based on member reviews done during Committee meetings. If the member has engaged in repeated abusive behavior, the member shall be expelled upon a majority vote of the members of the Expulsion Review Committee provided, however, that prior to expelling such a member, said member shall have been provided notice in writing of the intent to vote upon expelling the member by the Expulsion Review Committee, which notice shall be mailed no fewer than thirty (30) days prior to such meeting. If the member may be reasonably inferred as posing an immediate danger to persons or property, the member may be expelled immediately by the action of an appropriate Credit Union officer, provided, however, that said member shall be provided notice in writing of the expulsion, including of the member's right to appear at a meeting of the Expulsion Review Committee to ask that the decision to expel be reviewed, within thirty (30) days of the date such notice is mailed to the member. Credit Union officers who may immediately expel a member under this process include the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Experience Officer, Chief Risk Officer, or AVP, Specialty Banking and Fraud Prevention. Other actions that may be imposed against either members and non-members are: Any other actions deemed appropriate under the circumstances that are not precluded by the Federal Credit Union Act, the New York Banking Law, NCUA Rules and Regulations, NYS DFS Rules and Regulations, the Credit Union\u2019s Bylaws or other applicable federal or state law. Referrals to the appropriate federal, state and/or local authorities.

The Program must be appropriate to the size and complexity of the financial institution or creditor and the nature and scope of its activities. The initial written Program must also be approved by the Board of Directors. To avoid duplication and reduce redundancy costs, Section I of the guidelines clarifies that a covered entity may incorporate into its Program, as appropriate, its existing policies and procedures. For example, a credit union may incorporate any existing policies that it has already developed in connection with its fraud prevention program into its Program. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulations will apply to state chartered credit unions. SCOPE All AmeriCU Employees DEFINITIONS Identity Theft \\- The term 'identity theft' means a fraud committed using the identifying information of another person, subject to such further definition as the Commission may prescribe by regulation. Covered Account \\- An account that a financial institution or creditor offers or maintains, primarily for personal, family or household purposes, that involves or is designed to permit multiple payments or transactions such as a credit card account, mortgage loan, automobile loan, margin account, cell phone account, utility account, checking account, or savings account; and any other account that the financial institution or creditor offers or maintains for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to customers or to the safety and soundness of the financial institution or creditor from identity theft, including financial, operational, compliance, reputation or litigation risks. RESPONSIBILITY The Assistant Vice President (AVP), Specialty Banking & Fraud Prevention is responsible for ensuring that the Program (including Red Flags determined to be relevant) is updated periodically, to reflect changes in risks to customers and to the safety and soundness of the financial institution from identity theft. Compliance of the Program by this financial institution will be incorporated into the Member Information Protection \u2013 Annual Report to Board. The report will include the effectiveness of the credit union's policies and procedures in addressing the risk of identity theft in connection with the opening of covered accounts and with respect to existing covered accounts; service provider arrangements; significant incidents involving identity theft and management's response; and recommendations for material changes to the Program. To ensure continuity of the program, the board will promptly designate a new Program Administrator in the event of personnel or organization changes. 1. ELEMENTS OF THE PROGRAM 1. _Risk Assessment_ Even though some accounts may present less risk for identity theft, the credit union has determined that its policy will be to treat _all_ member accounts as \"covered accounts\" for the purposes of this Identity Theft Prevention Program. 2. _Categories of Red Flags_ 1. While no list of Red Flags can be all-inclusive, the credit union has identified relevant Red Flags it is most likely to encounter, as listed in Appendix A to this policy. Alerts, notifications, or other warnings received from consumer reporting agencies or service providers, such as fraud detection services; The presentations of suspicious documents; The presentations of suspicious personal identifying information, such as suspicious address change; The unusual use of or other suspicious activity related to a covered account; and Notice from customers/members, victims of identity theft, law enforcement authorities or other persons regarding possible identity theft in connection with covered accounts held by the financial institution 3. _Detecting and Responding to Red Flags_ 1. Effective October 1, 2003, the U.S. Patriot Act (Customer Identification Program (CIP) rule 31 C.F.R. 103.121) requires all financial institutions to strictly follow certain guidelines when opening a new account or adding a new name to an existing account. The purpose of this act is to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, identity theft, and other forms of fraud. This regulation requires AmeriCU to implement a Member Identification Program (MIP) and stricter enforcement of the Bank Secrecy Act and OFAC surveillance. The MIP program concentrates on account opening, verifying the new member and maintaining identification records. This program requires AmeriCU to verify the identity of any new person seeking to open an account or be added to an existing account. Existing members do not fall under this act unless there is a reasonable doubt of their identity. Failure to do so shall be grounds for disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment and referral of the matter to law enforcement. Reference: Policy No.: ACU-11-005 - Member Identification Policy along with corresponding procedures 2. Member Address Changes. For members who have been issued debit or credit cards, the credit union has adequate procedures to validate address change requests if it receives an address change request and, within a short period of time thereafter (30 days or less) are requested to issue a replacement or additional card. No cards will be issued or sent until the address change has been validated. Reference: Visa Check Card \u2013 Red Flag Procedures/Credit Card Address Changes \u2013Native Screens 3. Fraud Detection Services. QualiFile is a Risk Averse strategy, which based on limited number of conditions will result in an outright Decline, Review or Accept response of a consumer applicant. Reference: ChexSystems Information Sentry Service is comprised of Inquiry Monitor and Report Monitor. This service monitors the number of inquiries of a Name/SSN during a particular period and generates alerts. These alerts are notified to the financial institutions and a report is sent in case of any closure reports. Reference: Reviewing ChexSystems (Sentry Services) and OFAC alerts Falcon is a Fraud Detection System that uses network technology to \"learn\" individual spending behavior on your debit card. The system then analyzes authorization and compares it to your spending behavior and current fraud trends.

CBCInnovis is an authentication/cross check report, which helps to interpret report results. Reference: Mortgage Loan procedures 2. _Preventing and Mitigating Identity Theft_ 1. The privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 required NCUA and the other financial institution regulators to establish appropriate standards relating to the administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for consumer records and information. In early 2001, NCUA issued a rule amending Part 748 to require such safeguards as part of all federally-insured credit unions' security programs and provided guidance to assist credit unions in meeting these requirements, which were included in the rule as \"Appendix A to Part 748 \u2013 Guidelines for Safeguarding Member Information.\" Reference: Policy No.: ACU-11-003 - Member Information Protection Policy and corresponding procedures. 2. Oversee service provider arrangements . Steps are taken to ensure that all third-party providers can safeguard our member's information in a reasonable manner. Reference: Policy No.: ACU-11-011 Third Party Risk Management Policy. 3. The Federal Financial Institution's Examination Council's guidance on authentication, information security standards. These guidelines provide guidance for developing and implementing administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of member information. It also addresses standards with respect to the proper disposal of consumer information. Reference: (12 CFR 748, App. A) and procedure 10.07 Minimum Safeguards of Member Information. 4. To address the increasing number of breaches or attempted breaches of member information that has resulted in the rapid escalation of identity theft over the past several years, NCUA issued a final rule that amended Part 748 to require credit unions to include within their security programs a response program when there is unauthorized access to or use of member information that could result in substantial harm or serious inconvenience to a member. The final rule also includes \"Appendix B to Part 748-Guidance on Response Programs for Unauthorized Access to Member Information and Member Notice.\" Reference: Policy No.: ACU-11-021 - Guidance on Response Programs for Unauthorized Access to Member Information and Member Notice and corresponding procedures. 5. Suspicious Activity Reporting . In the event a credit union employee detects any known or suspected federal criminal violation or pattern of criminal violations committed against the credit union or involving a transaction or transactions conducted through the credit union, the credit union will file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR). A summary characterization of suspicious activity includes, but is not limited to: Bank Secrecy Act/Structuring/Money Laundering, Check Fraud, Check Kitting, Counterfeit Check, Debit Card Fraud, Credit Card Fraud, Mortgage/Consumer Loan Fraud, Wire Transfer Fraud, Identify Theft, Computer Intrusion, etc. Reference: Policy No. ACU-11-006 BSA-AML Policy, ACU-11-031 OFAC Policy and corresponding procedures. 6. Train appropriate staff to effectively implement the program . The Risk & Compliance Committee will develop a training program on all classes and BAI courses completed new regulations and changes to existing regulations necessary to insure compliance. HR Training will maintain records of all training by employees. Testing may also be included in order to ensure that the prescribed comprehension levels are met.

SCOPE All AmeriCU Employees DEFINITIONS _Member (customer) \u2013_ For the purposes of this policy, a \"member\" is an individual or legal entity that is opening a new account with the credit union. It also means an individual or legal entity that is opening a new account for another individual who lacks legal capacity (such as a minor or an incompetent) or for a group that has not formed a legal entity (such as a civic club). In the case of a joint account, it means each of the account holders who does not already have an account with the credit union. _Account_ \u2013 For the purpose of this program, an \"account\" is a formal credit union relationship established to provide services or engage in financial dealings or services. It includes deposit accounts, loans and other forms of credit, safe deposit box rentals, safekeeping services, cash management, and custodian and trust services. It does not include such relationships if they are acquired through a merger, acquisition, or purchase and assumption. It also excludes check cashing, wire transfer, and sale of check or money order, if no formal credit union relationship, as described earlier in this paragraph, is established. _U.S. Person_ \u2013 For purposes of this program, a \"U.S. Person\" is an individual who is a United States citizen, by birth or naturalization, or a person (other than an individual, such as a corporation or partnership) that is established or organized under the laws of the United States or one of its states.

Individual Member Not Present: Mail or Fax Opening member accounts through the mail or fax are considered higher risk relative to fraud and the USA Patriot Act. Extra precautions must be taken in order to protect the Credit Union and its membership in accordance with the Opening Accounts Procedure by mail or fax. When a mailed request to open an account is received at a Financial Center, the member not present procedure will be followed. If documentary identification is not provided or the non-documentary information is inconclusive, the account is not to be opened and all applications/requests are returned to the individual with a letter stating the reason it could not be opened. Once the account is opened, all documents used to verify are sent to Imaging, including copies of any correspondence and Internet inquiries. 8. School Banking A risk based exception has been granted to allow students of designated schools to open savings accounts without the parent being present. This exception is only allowed if the application if filled out by the parent and a legible copy of the parent's identification is provided. This is for a savings account only. If student and/or parents want a checking account they need to follow standard ID verification as outlined above in \"Documentary\". 9. Virtual Branch If a potential or current member opens an account via the Virtual Branch DocuSign (e-Signature) process, the following identification authentication method will be utilized: ID Check validates a signer using a knowledge-based authentication (KBA) process that generates from other sources (i.e. Credit Bureau), which generates 6 identification questions and all questions must be answered correctly for the potential member to be granted access to the account opening documents. A ChexSystems, CrossCore and OFAC inquiry will be performed. 10. Lack of Identification: If the credit union is not familiar with the documents presented, is unable to verify the true identity of a member through documents or ID Check or is unable to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identify of a new member, the account will not be opened. 11. Comparison with Government List: Reasonable procedures for determining whether the member appears on any list of the known or suspected terrorists or terrorist's organizations provided to the Credit Union by any government agency is required by the regulatory statue. The names of all persons subject to this policy shall be checked against current Office of Foreign Asset Control (\"OFAC\") control lists and against any other lists of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations provided to the Credit Union by a federal government agency.

A risk assessment is an on-going process of discovering, correcting, and preventing information security problems. They are performed to identify and qualify both potential and realized risks because of inadvertent misconfiguration, weak authentication, insufficient error handling, sensitive information leakage, etc. Discovery and mitigation of these issues will limit the attack surface of AmeriCU\u2019s services available both internally and externally as well as satisfy compliance with any relevant policies in place. SCOPE This program covers any risk assessment for the purposes of maintaining the security posture, compliance, risk management, and technologies in use at AmeriCU. All risk assessments will be performed by delegated security personnel either employed or contracted by AmeriCU. All findings are considered confidential and are to be distributed to persons on a \u201cneed to know\u201d basis. Distribution of any findings outside of AmeriCU is prohibited unless approved by the Chief Risk Officer. Any relationships within multi- tiered applications found during the scoping phase will be included in the assessment unless explicitly limited. Limitations and subsequent justification will be documented during the assessment process. DEFINITIONS N/A RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS Identification Information security risk analysis is primarily a tool supporting management decisions relating to IT. All risks are assessed based on the ISO 27001 Risk Rating Methodology. When a risk is identified, it is assigned a type (violation, process/procedure, observation, documentation, or infrastructure), a risk owner (a VP level), and a lead owner (the person responsible for implementing risk treatment). The Information Security team then determines the raw probability, and raw impact in terms of a percentage using the formula below: Risk (%) = Probability (%) x Impact(%) This formula ranks and prioritizes threats and vulnerabilities to provide management of our current risk profile. Once identified, the risk treatment is determined. The lead owner will collaborate with the Information Security team to determine a treatment to remediate, reduce, or diminish the impact and/or probability of a risk and the treatment cost. The treatment is then evaluated by the Information Security team and a treated probability and treated impact is assigned as a percentage. The formula below is used to determine the target risk rating using the treated probability and treated impact: Target Risk (%) = Treated Probability (%) x Treated Impact (%) The information security team must update the treatment status as necessary, and a current risk classification is determined using the following formula: Residual Risk Rating (%) = (Raw risk rating \u2013 treatment status) (%) \u00d7 (Raw risk rating \u2013 target risk rating) (%) Based on the residual risk rating, a risk classification from low to critical is calculated using the following formula based on the ISO 27001 Risk Rating Methodology: Risk Classifications --- Risk Class | Range | Color Low | <= 29.9% | Green Medium | 30% - 59.9% | Yellow High | 60% - 98.9% | Red Critical | 99% - 100% | Black RISK ASSESSMENT MONTHLY REPORT On a monthly basis, the Information Security team will verify and validate the risk registry with the respective lead owners and provide the executive team with a final report. The dissemination of the report and respective risk item and status communications shall include: The Information Security team will update the risk registry and forward them to the lead owners on or before the 15th of every month, as appropriate. The lead owners will provide updates on the treatment status of all risks that fall under their responsibility before the 22nd of every month, as appropriate. The Risk Registry will be updated based on these monthly reports and sent to the Risk Owners by the 26th of every month. The Risk Owners will validate all risks that fall under their responsibility and sign-off on any new risks identified since the last monthly report. The Risk Owners will respond to Information Security by the end of the month. The Risk Assessment Monthly report will be finalized and delivered to the Chief Risk Officer. The Chief Risk Officer will review and provide a risk report to the Executive team by the 10th of every month, as appropriate. RISK RATING Critical \u2013 Any critical risk must be fixed as soon as possible, or other mitigation strategies must be put in place to limit exposure before deployment. Applications or servers with critical risk issues are subject to being taken off-line. High \u2013 High risk issues will be reviewed to determine what is required to mitigate and they will be scheduled accordingly. Applications or servers with high-risk issues may be taken off-line or denied release into the live environment. Issues will be fixed according to the Patch Management Policy and Program. Medium \u2013 Medium risk issues should be reviewed to determine what is required to mitigate and scheduled accordingly. Applications or servers with medium risk issues may be taken off-line or denied release into the live environment based on the number of issues and if multiple issues increase the risk to an unacceptable level. Issues should be fixed according to the Patch Management Policy and Program unless other mitigation strategies will limit exposure. Low \u2013 Issue should be reviewed to determine what is required to correct the issue and scheduled according to the Patch Management Policy and Program. Remediation validation testing will be required to validate fix and/or mitigation strategies for any discovered issues of medium risk level or greater.

The Information Security team is responsible for providing guidance to the risk owners and Lead owners, as well as validating the risk registry by the 15th of every month. The Vice President of information security is responsible for reviewing the monthly risk registry report and forwarding it to senior management for their review on or by the 1st of the following month. Risk Register The Risk Register is a tool for documenting, managing, and assessing risks. Below is a screenshot for reference: There are several pieces of information needed in the Risk Register to properly categorize a risk. Below is a description of each field in the Risk Register: Risk ID \u2013 Each risk must have a unique reference to be able to identify risks unambiguously. Date Discovered \u2013 The date the risk was discovered. Risk \u2013 A brief description of the risk so that people can understand what risk is being assessed. Additional information can be added to the Notes field. Risk Type \u2013 The category of risk that the risk belongs to. There are four types of risk: Violation \u2013 A risk that is created when policies and procedures are not being followed. Process/Program \u2013 A risk created when a process or program needs to be implemented or created. Infrastructure \u2013 A risk whose correction requires creation, implementation, and/or change to hardware or software. Documentation \u2013 A risk created by a lack of documentation regarding the risk. Risk Owner \u2013 The person who will be held accountable if the risk treatment is inadequate or an incident occurs. This person is a VP level or above and is responsible for assigning a tower lead and ensuring the risk is assessed and treated. Lead Owner \u2013 \"Boots on the ground\" owner of the risk. This person has a more technical role than the risk owner and is responsible for mitigating the risk by implementing the risk treatment developed in conjunction with Information Security. Impact \u2013 The potential impact should the risk occur in business terms. This is based on the worst-case scenario. Raw Probability \u2013 (%) The probability that the risk would occur if it were untreated, as a percentage value. Raw Impact \u2013 (%) The potential business impact if the risk occurred without treatment, as a percentage value. Raw Risk Rating \u2013 (%) The product of the raw impact and the raw probability. Treatment \u2013 How the risk is to be addressed. Note that controls are just one option: risks can also be avoided, transferred, or accepted. Treatment Cost \u2013 ($) The estimated total cost of mitigating the risk. Treatment Status \u2013 (%) The extent to which the treatment has been implemented, as a percentage value. 0% = treatment is only a plan at present - nothing has been done yet. Between 0% and 100% \u2013 estimated in 20% increments. 100% = treatment is fully operational. Treated Probability \u2013 (%) The probability that the risk will eventuate, once controls are fully in place. Treated Impact \u2013 (%) The impact once the controls are fully in place. Target Risk Rating \u2013 (%) The product of the treated probability and impact values once risk treatment is fully implemented. Residual Risk Rating \u2013 (%) The risk rating today, given implementation status, anticipated probability, and impact values once treatment is fully completed. For example, if the raw risk value is 50% and the treated risk value is 30% but the treatment is only 50% implemented, the Residual Risk level is 40%. In reality, many security controls are either fully implemented and fully effective, or partially implemented and not at all effective - but the risk calculation here considers the fact that work is under way; hence management can assume it will be treated at the right time. Ultimately, the risk owner accepts the risk at this level. Last Update \u2013 The date the risk was last reviewed, updated, and/ approved by management. Risk Owner Acceptance \u2013 Indicates that risk owner has accepted risk level for the particular risk. Notes \u2013 Comments from the Information Security team about the risks, e.g., factors that should have been considered, significant assumptions, etc. History \u2013 Comments from the risk owners and Lead owners regarding the status of risk treatment implementation.
